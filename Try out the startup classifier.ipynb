       "  u' We got our first glimpse of Navdy\\u2019s smart heads-up display for cars back in 2014 , when the company crowdfunded its way to around two and a half million dollars. Two years and around $26 million in venture capital later, it\\u2019s here: as of this morning, the Navdy is officially shipping. The idea behind Navdy is simple enough: take the stuff that might usually live on your phone\\u2019s screen (or on your car\\u2019s in-dash info system) and put it on a screen that is, in theory, less distracting. But the execution of that idea is where things get fun, with the final product looking like something out of The Fifth Element. They blast your GPS routes, text messages, and other details onto an almost completely-clear piece of glass that sits just inside of your windshield, just below your natural line of site while driving. When it all lines up just right, it sort of looks like your GPS maps (or your texts, album art, etc.) are floating on the road in front of you. Meanwhile, the device has sensors watching for hand gestures in the air space just above your steering wheel. Want to answer an incoming call? Just swipe your hand to the left, and boom: call answered, jedi-style. Alas, the Navdy has gotten a bit pricier since its 2014 pre-orders. Whereas the earliest of adopters were able to get in on the ground floor for $299 and the company projected the retail price to come in at around $499 , the final cost of the Navdy has since hiked its way up to $799. That\\u2019s\\u2026 pretty steep, for a device that primarily doubles as a more convenient and/or potentially less distracting means of doing stuff that, for the most part, your smartphone already does. Meanwhile, Anker \\u2014 a company known for building solid stuff on the cheap \\u2013 has already announced their plans to build something similar enough that it\\u2019s hard to avoid calling it a clone. With all that said: damn , this thing looks cool in person. Navdy sent us a unit to check out for a few days, so we\\u2019ll have a full review sometime soon.',\n",

       "  u'Travel and transportation\\xa0have always been major focus points for the tech world. Why? Because people will always want to get from points A to B, and to do it faster and cheaper than before. GoEuro \\u2014 a startup based out of Berlin \\u2014 is a\\xa0company to watch here because it straddles both of these industries. Come hear how GoEuro is\\xa0doing this \\u2014 and making a success of it \\u2014 when its CEO Naren Shaam takes to the stage in a fireside chat next month, at TechCrunch\\u2019s Disrupt London event, December 5-6. Like other travel portals, GoEuro\\u2019s\\xa0focus is on helping people plan their travel and book their tickets. Uniquely, to find the answer, GoEuro offers\\xa0a special twist: it presents\\xa0an aggregated view of all possible routes to get there \\u2014 be it by plane, train or bus \\u2014 to figure out what might be fastest, and what\\xa0will cost the least. It\\u2019s a very European solution to a global challenge, and is all the more interesting when you consider that the founder (pictured, right) is from the U.S. \\u2014 yet building his startup (and raising tons of money) out of Berlin. This, combined with the tech that GoEuro has built, makes for an interesting company that has a lot of potential in the years ahead, not just in Europe but the rest of the world. Come join us in London to hear about how GoEuro is going places. The two-day Disrupt conference runs December 5 to 6 in the Olympic Village\\u2019s Copper Box Arena and features Startup Alley and Startup Battlefield where one startup will take home \\xa330,000. You can buy early-bird tickets for Disrupt London here. You want to display your company? Then go for a booth in the Startup Alley. For startups there is also the brand new CrunchMatch program where we match startups to investors. Check it all out here . Extra early bird tickets are now available to purchase for the discounted price of just \\xa3950 a piece. You can get your tickets at this price until 4 November. And for all you students out there, the deal is about to get even sweeter. We have a limited selection of student tickets to Disrupt London 2016 for just \\xa3100 plus VAT, provided you have both a valid university ID and current transcripts. To reserve your \\xa3100 student tickets to Disrupt, simply send a copy of your transcripts showing your current enrollment status, as well as a copy of your university identification card to students@techcrunch.com.

       "  u'For those doubting that autonomous vehicles\\xa0are going to\\xa0be driving alongside humans very soon, consider the first delivery made by Otto while a driver actually left the driver\\u2019s seat during the long highway portion of the trip: The Uber-owned self-driving transport truck company made its first delivery recently, moving 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins, CO to Colorado Springs . The inaugural delivery saw the truck\\u2019s human driver navigate the city portions of the trip, letting the experienced professional handle foot traffic, stop signs with busy intersections and other unpredictables like people walking dogs, and then took over once the rig had successfully merged onto Interstate 25, handling the relatively simple highway drive for 120 miles, while the Otto\\u2019s driver actually left his seat, since the truck is capable of full Level 4 autonomy while on the highway, keeping distance between itself and cars ahead, and changing lanes very rarely when the system decides it absolutely has to do so. Otto\\u2019s technology includes $30,000 worth of additional hardware that can work with any big rig that uses an automatic transition. Six test trucks are in place in the Bay area, continually running trials while tweaking software. The company\\u2019s also addressing a big need \\u2013 current estimates put truck driver numbers at almost 50,000 below the actual demand, and the lack of qualified people willing to do the job is actually widening. Uber acquired Otto last summer and has said it will continue to run the company as a separate brand. Expect to see its self-driving tech start becoming a much more common site on actual roads long before we see autonomous personal consumer cars with any kind of regularity. Via Wired',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/red-sift/',\n",
       "  u'Red Sift , a new London startup from two ex-Shazamers, is building an ambitious cloud-based and developer platform that wants to enable individuals and businesses to plug in various data sources and make that data actually work for them in a meaningful way. This could be anything from unlocking the treasure trove of data in our email to get insights and improve productivity to visualising data from Google Analytics and sending graphs to a Slack channel. Built around open micro-services \\u2014 or \\u201cSifts,\\u201d as the company calls them \\u2014 the idea is that any developer can add to or tweak the growing library of mini-apps that will reside on the Red Sift platform. \\u201cEveryday data sources such as email, messaging platforms, web applications and IoT devices generate vast amounts of data, most of which lacks structure and is difficult to aggregate and summarise,\\u201d says Red Sift co-founder and CEO Rahul Powar. \\u201cBecause of this, it often remains archived without us being able to draw any valuable insight from it\\u201d. (Of note: Powar was part of the founding team at music recognition app Shazam where he previously held the role of Chief Technical Architect at Shazam. He then left to found Appsmart, which was acquired by Reuters in 2012.) \\u201cWe do this through the use of \\u201cSifts\\u201d \\u2014 smart, open source micro services that run computations on your data securely to deliver information in your dashboard or messaging channels. Sifts can be created by us or the community as our platform allows developers and eventually regular users to create their own Sifts simply and rapidly,\\u201d explains Powar. So, for example, one of the micro-services Powar currently has plugged into his email tells him if the sender and he are connected directly or indirectly via Twitter or AngelList. \\u201cIn a mailing list folder or a mailbox that gets a lot of cold/inbound messages, I get a green or amber indicator against people I am connected with giving me a new and sophisticated signal to triage my inbox with,\\u201d he says. Or another \\u201cSift\\u201d monitor a user\\u2019s inbox for receipts from online taxi companies and aggregates that data to provide monthly and yearly spending summaries and journey analysis. But perhaps its real power is the developer-friendly and open source nature of the mini-apps housed on Red Sift, which will enable functionality to be modified or extended to provide a different insight or functionality on any given data set. Meanwhile, to gear Red Sift up for a full launch early next year, the startup has raised $2 million in a round led by White Star Capital and Oxford Capital with participation from Entr\\xe9e Capital.',\n",

According to CEO George Avetisov, what HYPR does is to decentralize and encrypt biometric data, making it a pain for hackers to get their hands on it in the first place, and requiring them to go after targets one by one, instead of breaking into a huge treasure trove of data through one corporate system. With HYPR, a user\\u2019s fingerprint, facial traits, or other biometric data is at least temporarily stored\\xa0on their mobile device. HYPR encrypts this data, so it never leaves their tablet or phone directly. If a bank requires a user to scan their iris before they can make any transfer over a certain amount, HYPR sends the bank a token verifying\\xa0the user\\u2019s identity for just that instance, so the bank doesn\\u2019t need to receive\\xa0any actual scan of the customer\\u2019s eye. This process, called \\u201ctokenization,\\u201d is what makes chip-based credit cards safer than those with magnetic strips, too. HYPR has closed a $3 million seed round to make its cybersecurity products known within and beyond financial services where the company has gained early traction. HYPR\\u2019s CEO said the company sees demand for biometric security in every industry from banking to automotive and consumer electronics today. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a good user experience to have to log into your toaster with a password. And you don\\u2019t want to unlock your home or car door with a PIN that someone could hack and steal,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAs more and more IoT devices become part of our lives, we will work with manufacturers to make them all as safe as a bank\\u2019s mobile app.\\u201d HYPR\\u2019s seed backers include: RTP Ventures , Boldstart Ventures and Mesh Ventures. RTP Ventures Managing Director Kirill Sheynkman, previously the CEO and cofounder of Plumtree Software, said he expects HYPR to use its funding for hiring, and to work with customers in financial services, health insurance and the Internet of Things. \\u201cI believe in this day and age you have to focus your marketing, sales and business development on vertical markets,\\u201d the investor said. Sheynkman said one of the reasons he backed HYPR is that the company\\u2019s timing is great. Biometrics are just becoming mainstream, but HYPR already has clients and a serious product in the market, the investor noted. Our office doors may not be equipped with face-scannning locks quite yet, but smartphones from the iPhone to the Google Pixel use a fingerprint sensor, and myriad bank apps are using speaker recognition (a.k.a. voice prints) to verify users. Juniper Research forecasts that by 2019, users will be downloading 770 million\\xa0biometric authentication apps annually, compared to an estimated 6 million just last year.',\n",

       "  u'Blackberry\\u2019S 5.5-Inch Dtek60 Is The Company\\u2019S Nicest Smartphone To Date, But Is It Enough?',\n",
       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/dtek-60-review/',\n",
       "  u'You can\\u2019t keep a good BlackBerry down. BlackBerry is dead, long live BlackBerry. Or, at the very least, you shouldn\\u2019t count your BlackBerrys before they\\u2019ve hatched. Because this certainly isn\\u2019t the first time the company has been declared dead, but through a combination of software offerings, intellectual property and a devoted fanbase, the Canadian smartphone maker\\xa0keeps powering through. And now, a mere weeks after the press declared the final nail plunged into its coffin when\\xa0it announced the end of in-house hardware production, the company is back. With a new piece of hardware, no less. Of course, as its name implies, BlackBerry\\u2019s new handset has much more in common with the company\\u2019s most recent offering, the DTEK50 than past devices \\u2013 which is to say that it has, as announced\\xa0outsourced hardware production here once again. In fact, the same company is responsible for both devices \\u2013 and it shows. Chinese hardware maker TCL, the manufacturer\\xa0behind Alcatel\\u2019s devices. In fact, the phone looks to be tweaked version of the TCL 950 handset which has been popping up around the web in recent months. As with that device, the DTEK60 brings a 5.5-inch display to the proceedings (a decent size increase over the 50\\u2019s 5.2-inch screen \\u2013 and BlackBerry\\u2019s largest to date) and a 21-megapixel rear-facing camera. So, what sets the device apart from TCL\\u2019s version? Familiar branding aside, the new phone will sink or swim on its software offering \\u2013 the same suite of security and productivity apps\\xa0that came loaded on its last phone. If nothing else, going back to the TCL well has insured a sense of aesthetic consistency across the nascent DTEK hardware line. Honestly, I wasn\\u2019t in love with the look of recessed frame that surrounds the display, but it\\u2019s a handy way to move the speakers to the front of the device, while offering aesthetic identity beyond an army of iPhone lookalikes. While the display itself isn\\u2019t curved, a la Samsung\\u2019s handsets, it does taper on either side of the display in a manner akin to what you\\u2019ll find on the Google Pixel. Above the screen is a black bezel housing a front facing 8-megapixel camera, alongside what the company has deemed a \\u201cselfie flash.\\u201d Also like the Pixel, the bottom bezel is just empty, devoid of a physical home button. The Power button is positioned on the left side of the device above SIM/MicroSD slot and the volume rocker is on the right, alongside the same \\u201cConvenience Key\\u201d found on the 50, which can be associated with different instantly launchable tasks. I connected my to Spotify. Not really necessary, but a nice feature for launching a favorite app with one hand. Though it\\u2019s positioned at the exact perfect spot for accidental triggers. The handset dutifully maintains a headphone jack on top, with a USB-C port on the bottom \\u2013\\xa0swapping out the 50\\u2019s microUSB. BlackBerry\\xa0has also traded\\xa0the rubbery textured backing for a glass surface \\u2013 a much more aesthetically pleasing design that helps the DTEK 60 secure the title of the most premium touchscreen smartphone it\\xa0has ever produced \\u2013 or lent its name to, at least. The familiar BlackBerry \\u201cB\\u201d logo is smack dab in the center of the back \\u2013 the Canadian company\\u2019s only branding on the hardware itself. Gone, it seems, are the days BlackBerry could spell out the brand in big bold letters on the fronts of its devices. Above the logo is a centrally placed finger reader, and above that, the 21-megapixel camera, which is a far cry from the Pixel\\u2019s camera bump-free boast. In fact, it\\u2019s one of the more prominent that I\\u2019ve seen in recent memory, save, perhaps for the Moto Z\\u2019s which was designed to be swallowed up by one of those modular backings. On a whole, however, it\\u2019s actually a lovely bit of design. The handset feels premium, while managing to avoid the lookalike trappings of many other flagship devices. Of course, all the credit for design once again goes to TCL on this one. But if anything, it\\u2019s a sign that it was probably time to let some other company do all of the heavy lifting in the hardware department. Of course, once again, BlackBerry\\u2019s hoping brand loyalty and a proprietary software suite will be enough to set it apart from the pack. DTEK doesn\\u2019t really roll off the tongue like the Curve, the Bold, the Storm, or even the Z30 (the Priv, let\\u2019s be honest, was borderline, at best). But, then, that\\u2019s what you get when you name your premium line of handsets after security software. It\\u2019s easy to see why the company went that route, of course. As the company struggles through an identity crisis after adopting Android and ending in-house hardware production, security remains a key pillar. It\\u2019s the reason why, until this summer, the President still carried one of the handsets around. And hey, with Samsung (the other security-minded handset maker) currently against the ropes, the company may have a previously unforeseen opening into the hearts, minds, and pockets of people and companies for whom such features are a primary selling point. The DTEK software at the heart of that security system offers a simplified method for keeping track of app permissions. In a meeting before the handset\\u2019s launch, a rep mentioned that, during its research, the company stumbled upon a flashlight app for Android that uploads a user\\u2019s location 50 times a day. And indeed, we should all be a bit more mindful of which permissions we\\u2019re surrendering to third-party developers\\xa0\\u2013 even\\xa0ones as seemingly innocuous as a flashlight. At the top of DTEK is a simple meter that ranges from red to green, based on the strength of your security setup. There are a dozen different settings, starting with apps and permissions. A few of them are really BlackBerry patting itself on the back, giving you a green checkmark for \\u201cusing a BlackBerry device\\u201d and having a device \\u201crunning Android, specifically designed for your BlackBerry device.\\u201d But it\\u2019s a handy and simple feature nonetheless, bringing security to the forefront in a simple, user-friendly manner. As the company looks to more aggressively market it software to manufacturers, it\\u2019s easy to imagine DTEK showing up on non-BlackBerry devices \\u2013 even if they won\\u2019t\\xa0get that extra green checkmark for just being a BlackBerry. The whole of the handset\\u2019s software is pretty much exactly what you\\u2019ll find on the DTEK 50, right down to the Android 6.0.1. Once again, it\\xa0offers a familiar suite of BlackBerry software selections on top, including BlackBerry Hub, which is accessible from the desktop via a small tap on the right. That offer brings the company\\u2019s productivity functionality front and center, pulling a slew of communications into single channel, including email, social media, text, phone, calendar events and, of course, BBM. The BlackBerry Intelligent keyboard is back as well, a reminder of a simpler age when the company could still count on its physical QWERTY as a major selling point as the competition increasingly fled to touchscreen typing. Here the company looks to increase speed with little flourishes like the ability to get predictive suggestions by hovering fingers over keys. The DTEK 60 is an Android phone with Blackberry software loaded on top. Kudos for not going crazy with the skins or attempting to tweak Google\\u2019s operating system beyond recognition. BlackBerry enthusiasts will likely find comfort in the familiar bits and pieces that have been maintained from older devices, but for better or worse, what we\\u2019re dealing with here is yet another Android handset. The DTEK\\u2019s quality is more than just skin deep. There are actually some solid specs on for the price point as well. The display clocks in at 2560 x 1440, which works out to 534 PPI \\u2013 that\\u2019s the same resolution you\\u2019ll find on the Pixel XL. It\\u2019s bright and features a pleasing\\xa0color balance. The battery is smaller than Google\\u2019s 3,450mAh, but its 3,000mAh got me through a day and a half of standard use (Spotify, Facebook and the like) without having to charge \\u2013 and when you do need to plug in, there\\u2019s a quick charge option to top off quickly. The 21-megapixel camera isn\\u2019t as well-rounded as Google\\u2019s offering, but it\\u2019s definitely the best I\\u2019ve seen on a BlackBerry. Pictures came out grainy in low light and reds\\xa0came out a bit over saturated when using the default HDR mode, but they\\u2019ll do the trick for most users in more settings. And while the Snapdragon 820 isn\\u2019t the latest and greatest, it does a lot of heavy lifting when coupled with the 4GB of RAM. Same goes for the 32GB of storage \\u2013 not the most generous offering we\\u2019ve seen on a handset, but the MicroSD slot lets users expand like crazy, up to a theoretical 2TB. All in all, pretty good specs for $499. BlackBerry had to kill its hardware in order to save it. There\\u2019s a lot to be said for a company that can develop both hardware and\\xa0software and all of the ecosystem harmony that comes with it, but that ship sailed a long time ago. At the end of the day, working with a hardware manufacturer qualified to make a great smartphone by 2016 standards was probably a good move, particularly given that the company had already embraced Android. The DTEK 60 is the best BlackBerry touchscreen smartphone to date \\u2013 though in 2016, it\\u2019s hard to say what that really means anymore. And while BlackBerry definitely still has its followers, it\\u2019s hard to imagine there being a mainstream\\xa0following after it has slowly surrendered various pillars of its business. The security features are nice, but they likely don\\u2019t set the company apart enough to really make a splash. At the end of the day, what we\\u2019re left with is a good Android phone with some nice features piled on top. Is it enough to resurrect BlackBerry\\u2019s hardware department? No. But it definitely has the makings of a\\xa0solid handset.',\n",

       "  u'Matt Zeiler grew up in a Canadian\\xa0farming community \\u2014 but fast forward a few decades and he\\u2019s now running a startup that\\u2019s looking to bring the same kinds of visual search tools that Pinterest and Google have to other companies and developers. That company is Clarifai, a New York-based startup that offers developers the ability to tag metadata to photos in such a way that the company algorithmically learns what kinds of objects are in photos. With that, Clarifai developers can train algorithms to be able to search for those objects, or input their own photos in order to find similar objects. The company said today that it has raised $30 million. The round was\\xa0led by Menlo Ventures, with\\xa0Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital and others participating. In total. Clarifai has $41.25 million in financing. While Google, Pinterest and other companies build visual search technology, Clarifai is looking to do the same but focus on giving third-party applications and developers access to that kind of technology. Zeiler says Clarifai only needs a few images\\u2019 worth of data to start building out a model for determining what kinds of objects are in an image. Developers can teach algorithms with their own kinds of tagging to build new classes of \\u201cobjects\\u201d within those images and videos. \\u201cOur number one entry point into our customer is a developer,\\u201d Zeiler said. \\u201cThink of Twilio, they were very much developer first and API\\xa0platform company for communications. We are the same thing for AI, we like to going to meet-ups\\xa0and hosting events at our office, going to hackathons. We want\\xa0to get every developer talking about and using Clarifai, building their next app on Clarifai, so one day someone is building the next Snapchat in their garage and we want to grow wit their growth.\\u201d Clarifai makes its tools available in the form of APIs that start off as easy-to-implement lines of code \\u2014 geared even toward first-time developers or programmers, in the same fashion that Twilio does \\u2014 to more in-depth tools that allow greater levels of customization. If it were able to tap into the same developer zeitgeist that Twilio has, there may be a similar path to\\xa0a strong business in the same way Twilio built. Clarifai\\u2019s goal is to essentially give the same tools that the Googles and Pinterests have, and point them downstream to developers and other companies like retailers. For example, Walmart might want to use something like this, or Macy\\u2019s, but in working with a company like Google those retailers\\xa0could end up giving retail data to competitors. They then may end up giving those companies a way to build something competitive. \\u201cWe view the big guys as our main competition\\xa0now, there\\u2019s a few entrants now, we\\u2019re not hearing as much about other startups in the space,\\u201d Zeiler said. \\u201cA lot of startups continue to get acquired, that\\u2019s great for us, we celebrate that internally because I wanted to build the independent AI company. There needs to be one. They have to trust us with their data and a lot of companies don\\u2019t trust Google, Microsoft, other big guys with their data because they know they\\u2019re gonna learn from it and turn around and build a competing product.\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'Scientists writing in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific have found unusual signals emanating from a group of stars that are \\u201csignals probably from extraterrestrial intelligence.\\u201d The signals \\u201chave exactly the shape of a signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this [extraterrestrial intelligence] hypothesis.\\u201d Their paper, \\u201cDiscovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars,\\u201d details their hypothesis that these signals indicate some sort of alien intelligence. \\u201cThe fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis\\u201d the paper\\u2019s authors, E.F. Borra and E. Trottier, wrote. Before you go out and found a doomsday cult it should be noted that these signals are not completely confirmed to be generated by intelligent life. In fact, the signals could be formed by chemical reactions in certain stars. \\u201cAt this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed with further work,\\u201d write the authors. \\u201cAlthough unlikely, there is also a possibility that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars.\\u201d The signals are a set of repeated bursts that would suggest an effort by aliens to notify us of their presence. Not many are buying the claim. Seth Shostak , senior astronomer at the SETI Institute, told Astronomy Magazine that the paper is ringing bells in the astronomy community. \\u201cApparently several \\u2014 more than three or four \\u2014 referees have been disinclined to see this published.

It\\u2019s a powerful analytics software solution with many different ways to visualize your data. \\u201cOur goal is to grow the company and become well-known,\\u201d co-founder and CEO Florian Douetteau told me. \\u201cWe want to become a global player in the analytics industry.\\u201d As machine learning and big data are becoming more and more important, a collaborative tool like Dataiku could be key when it comes to prototyping data-driven models and extracting data. This might sound obscure to you, but it turns out that many companies are using Dataiku every day, from SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. L\\u2019Or\\xe9al, Hostelworld, Bechtel and more are using the product. For instance, NPR uses Dataiku to make recommendations for shows that you\\u2019ll like based on what you\\u2019ve already listened to. Dataiku is compatible with other solutions from Microsoft, Cloudera, Tableau and more. It is also compatible with all sorts of database formats, from MySQL to NoSQL and Hadoop. There are many different applications. You could figure out your churn, analyze your costs, detect fraud and build predictive models in many different industries, from e-commerce to insurance and factories. I feel like Dataiku wants to be the starting point when companies are thinking about investing on data science. And this year has been a turning point for the company as the company has grown by 300 percent, doubled the size of its teams and more. That\\u2019s a great way to lead to a funding round.

       "  u'About.com is launching its third standalone brand in the form of Lifewire , a tech information and advice site. Lifewire will offer advice and answers on common tech questions and problems in the most clear, simplified format possible. About, the IAC-owned media company, is in the midst of a transition. Instead of serving information about how to bake a pie and how to manage your personal finances in the same place, the company is breaking up its various catalogs of DIY and how-to information into branded verticals. The shift started in spring of this year, with the launch of health and wellness site Verywell . Verywell launched with more than 50,000 pieces of content ranging from common medical conditions like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis to simple health tips like how to get more sleep or advice on fitness. In early September, About launched the second new vertical with The Balance , a personal finance site. Smaller than Verywell, The Balance launched with 34,000 pieces of existing content, all organized under the topics of personal finance, investing, money hacks, career advice, and small business tips. Lifewire will launch with 16,000 pieces of content written by 40 writers, all focused on how to fix products that aren\\u2019t working, what gear to buy, and how to get the most out of gadgets. CEO Neil Vogel said that the company is intent on not crossing the line into technology news, but rather offering more evergreen, informational content. About plans to launch five total branded sites. However, the next two (Home and Food) will feel a bit different from the existing verticals. Vogel says that with the first three sites, Verywell, the Balance and Lifewire, users are more likely to dive deep and narrow on a certain topic. But the Home and Food verticals are inherently more browsy. Lifewire may be one of the smallest verticals from About\\u2019s new portfolio, but the company chose to launch it before Home and Food (official names TBA) because they had already built out that topic-focused format with Verywell and the Balance. About\\u2019s transition to standalone brands not only benefits users, but helps the company get traction on social media, as well as serve more targeted, effective advertisements.

       "  u'Alexander Timm has been working in the insurance industry since he was 14. While that\\u2019s strange enough, what\\u2019s even weirder is that Timm really loves the work. He\\u2019s so enamored of the business that he\\u2019s founded his own insurance company, Root Insurance , to remake the process of applying for \\u2014 and insuring \\u2014 drivers. There\\u2019s a lot happening in the sleepy world of insurance that\\u2019s making it possible to drive costs down and provide better results for policyholders, says Timm. The founder of Columbus-based Root has spent his entire life working on insurance. He began working at Nationwide Insurance right out of college\\xa0and has launched Root to take the negative lessons he\\u2019d learned from that experience to create a different kind of insurance company for users. \\u201cAlthough we had these noble goals\\u2026 we weren\\u2019t adequately using machine learning and algorithms,\\u201d Timm said. \\u201cAt first I tried to change it from the inside, I wasn\\u2019t really able to make any progress.\\u201d So last March, Timm began talking to Drive Capital, the Columbus-based venture investment firm and managed to secure $3 million in initial funding. With that capital, the company began the lengthy process of applying for approval to issue insurance in Ohio. Today, the company is officially launching its services in the state and will then begin to roll out across the rest of the country. Drive subsequently put in another $4 million behind the company, which along with a debt facility for Silicon Valley Bank has given the company the cash it needed to develop. Root has already applied for approval in Illinois and intends to be in ten more states by the beginning of 2017. The company hopes to be nationwide by the end of next year. Unlike other insurers, everything Root is doing is handled on smartphones. Users can download the app, scan their drivers\\u2019 license and Root\\u2019s software automatically updates the insurance application with the necessary personal information. Root\\u2019s iPhone app then takes data from the accelerometer and other sensors on the smartphone and gauge an applicant\\u2019s driving skills. \\u201cFor the best 30% of drivers we cut the price [of insurance] in half,\\u201d says Timm. \\u201cFor the best 70% of drivers we\\u2019re the cheapest in the market.\\u201d Timm says that on average, Root, can save 20% on the typical\\xa0insurance policy. The lowest premiums the company has issued are $12 per month.\\xa0The company\\u2019s policies are reinsured by Munich Re, Maiden Re, and Odyssey Re. As technology continues to advance, Timm predicts that the insurance industry will be ripe for additional new entrants. \\u201cWe also saw this big data come in and suddenly sensors were on everything,\\u201d said Root\\u2019s chief executive. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to have to start using people\\u2019s data to actually help them.\\u201d Eventually, Timm wants to issue a single, simple contract for insurance. \\u201cYou just buy car insurance and you get $1 million of coverage,\\u201d Timm proposed. \\u201cWe want to make it the fairest simplest product.\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'Xiaomi has added\\xa0another mobile VR headset to its portfolio: announcing the Mi VR today \\u2014 which it says is its first virtual reality headset with an inertial motion controller. The company\\u2019s\\xa0debut VR device, the Mi VR Play , was revealed\\xa0this summer \\u2014 an entry level mobile VR headset\\xa0designed to house a smartphone, a la Samsung\\u2019s Gear VR, but with limited availability to beta testers only. The forthcoming Mi VR is going on more general release in China, priced at RMB 199 (~$30). As with other such mobile VR headsets, it\\xa0only works with\\xa0Xiaomi\\u2019s smartphones \\u2014 and is therefore tied to the company\\u2019s mobile market footprint. So don\\u2019t expect this to arrive in the US; Xiaomi will need to bring its smartphones to the market for that to be possible. The Mi VR hardware includes\\xa0a dedicated motion sensor and system-level optimizations for 16ms ultra-low latency, aimed at minimizing motion sickness (aka VR nausea). The headset also ships with the aforementioned 9-axis motion controller to support a wider range of interactions with content.\\xa0VR content for the device is downloaded from Xiaomi\\u2019s app store. Design wise the Mi VR\\xa0steps up from the \\u2018no-frills\\u2019\\xa0looking Mi VR Play \\u2014 but Xiaomi looks to have taken more than a little inspiration from Sony\\u2019s PlayStation VR .',\n",

       "  u'Following in the footsteps of Warby Parker, Everlane and Bonobos, a New York City startup called Lively has raised $4 million in seed funding to grow its direct-to-consumer lingerie brand. Incorporated as Intimates Online Inc., Lively was founded by CEO Michelle Cordeiro Grant, a long-time fashion insider. Working previously within the online division of Victoria\\u2019s Secret, and at apparel startups like Jack Threads, Cordeiro Grant said she saw a dearth of designs and companies built for women by women in the $13 billion lingerie market. \\u201cI saw all these brands built by men. And stories told in lingerie were basically about how you, as a woman, would put this bra on and think about how would the man perceive me in this,\\u201d she said. Today, Lively strives to provide women with lingerie that looks great and feels high-performance, more akin to swimwear than the push up bras, and \\u201cfantasy\\u201d looks pushed by traditional brands or the too-plain alternatives sold at mainstream retailers. The startup prides itself, the CEO said, on making lingerie, \\u201cin a broad size range, at an honest price in luxurious packaging,\\u201d and providing exceptional customer service. GGV Capital, an early backer of Poshmark, Alibaba and Airbnb, led the seed round in Lively. Gelmart International, the intimate apparel manufacturer, also invested, along with individual angels. GGV Capital Vice President Robin Li , now a board member at Lively, said one thing the firm liked about the lingerie startup was its ability to sell globally, from the start. The brand, in just six months, has racked up customers in dozens of countries, Li said. Additionally, Lively is resonating with influencers on social media and millennial shoppers who are willing to try new things, Li said. While Lively competes with retail and wholesale brands already well established in lingerie, like Victoria\\u2019s Secret, Uniqlo, Calvin Klein or Natori, the startup is facing fierce competition from startup peers in specialty lingerie and apparel. Lingerie sellers and apparel designers, including ThirdLove , AdoreMe and Outdoor Voices , raised funding to grow their businesses before Lively. And self-financed companies like Negative Underwear , a lingerie designer that sells direct to consumer, compete here too. Cordeiro Grant said she is actually happy to see activity in this massive market, especially from founders and designers who are women. Lively intends to use its seed capital for hiring, marketing, mobile app development, and eventual expansion into categories like loungewear, swimwear or activewear. But for the near-term it is focused on lingerie.',\n",

       "  u'\\u201cIt might shock you, but I let go of pretty much everybody. When we went from 34 employees to 4, everyone was sh*tting Twinkies. Everyone was scared to death.\\u201d For Steve Newcomb, the founder and CEO of Famous , \\u201cpivot\\u201d is not a strong enough word. \\u201cWe did a reboot,\\u201d he tells me in a stylish penthouse office that shouldn\\u2019t exist. His $30 million-funded open source JavaScript startup was going down in flames, with a spiraling burn rate and no business model. Laying off 90 percent of the company and forging an entirely different direction was the only option. \\u201cThis\\xa0was all my fault. These were great people.  It was the toughest professional thing I\\u2019ve ever had to do,\\u201d Newcomb wistfully recalls. But against all odds, he\\u2019s built something new, hired back up to 16 and suddenly has a product he can sell to brands for millions. Told for the first time, this is the startup redemption of Famous. It\\u2019s easy to fool yourself that you\\u2019re succeeding when there\\u2019s a line around the block to get into your open source JavaScript library\\xa0meetup. \\u201cI confused hype for traction,\\u201d Newcomb admits. He was used to winning. After raising $8 million as COO of his last company, Powerset, he sold the search engine startup to Microsoft for $100 million in 2008. That made scoring funds easy when he came up with the idea for Famous in 2011. Greylock, CrunchFund [Disclosure: same founder at TechCrunch], InterWest, Javelin, Quest and some angels fronted a seed round. At birth, Famo.us wanted to build mobile websites for iPads that felt as fast and full-featured as native apps. Then it wanted to create BenchRank, a ranking system for people. But Newcomb and teammate Mark Lu discovered the limitations of the HTML5 mobile web standard prevented them from developing sites that could compete with native apps. In 2012, Famo.us launched at TechCrunch Disrupt\\u2019s Startup Battlefield competition with a demo that was heavy on the flashy graphics, light on the business model. Rather than explain how clients could use Famo.us or how it would make money, Newcomb wasted the six-minute demo demanding that the audience imagine a future where apps were 3D\\u2026 whatever that meant. That\\u2019s because Newcomb and Lu had pivoted last-minute to build out an experimental JavaScript-based interface rendering engine, while former co-founder Dan Lynch left to start a different company. Yet Famo.us\\u2019 rendering engine\\xa0had the potential to become a backbone of the mobile web. It bypassed CSS and HTML rendering, and communicated directly with a computer\\u2019s graphics processing unit to produce impressive visuals. While weak on direction, the developer community was enamored with the idea of an alternative to HTML5. Facebook\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg had just called using HTML5 one of his company\\u2019s biggest mistakes. Venture capital and job applicants poured in, with Insight Venture Partners and Samsung Ventures joining the existing investors on Series A, B and debt rounds that fluffed Famo.us to $30 million in funding . On top of that, 1,200 developers showed up to one of its meetups, \\u201cand man did that feel good. I\\u2019m not gonna lie,\\u201d Newcomb recalls. \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re so popular. I\\u2019ll figure out the business model later.\\u201d But he didn\\u2019t. \\u201cWe scaled the company before we had product market fit.\\xa0We scaled the company before we had a business model that was anything for real. I wasn\\u2019t using lean startup methodology when I should have. And I had gone away from my passion,\\u201d Newcomb says, calmly cataloging his failures. Famo.us had hitched itself to the idea that it would give away its core technology platform as open-source software. Monetizing that valiant decision left Famo.us scrambling. It waffled from trying to sell development assistance for its platform to big hardware vendors, to bundling that with A/B testing, hosting and monitoring cloud services. But while 90,000 developers had signed up to try the platform, it was still half-baked and only a tiny fraction of those were allowed in, so there weren\\u2019t many clients to sell to. Approaching its peak headcount in 2015, Famo.us was hemorrhaging cash in its posh office, with a bleak venture climate on the horizon.\\xa0Newcomb likens it to the old Road Runner cartoons, \\u201c floating in mid-air like you\\u2019re Wil E. Coyote.\\u201d Famo.us had stumbled over the cliff, but just hadn\\u2019t realized it yet. The fall would come fast. He could try to raise a Series C on hype and keep pushing a broken business model. Yet Newcomb says, \\u201cTo close your eyes and hope it works out, that would be a soul-ripping venture for me.\\u201d He could try to sell Famo.us\\u2019 engineering team for whatever he could get, but after watching Powerset sell too early, he insisted that \\u201cThis one\\u2019s mine. This is my passion and I want to see this thing through to the end.\\u201d So he drove back and forth across the country while coming to grips with his decision. Famo.us\\u2019 tech would be left for the open-source community. And except for himself, co-founder Mark Lu, Greg Barto who ran operations and Sara Stoddard who ran the office, Newcomb would fire everyone at Famo.us. \\u201cWhen you broke the story, I didn\\u2019t want to confirm any of the names, it was an emotional time,\\u201d Newcomb says, referring to the TechCrunch article we published a year ago about sourced accounts of the fall of Famo.us. The decisive choice was critical, though. Sure enough, a fundraising frost set in at the end of 2015, killing or crippling startups with too high a burn-rate or too little money in the bank. \\u201cI saw the market getting tight and we were one of the first companies to pull the plug,\\u201d Newcomb tells me.\\xa0\\u201cI\\xa0knew it was an admission of how much I was wrong. And I was way wrong, and it ultimately led me to have to say goodbye to a lot of wonderful people.\\u201d Jed Katz, a Famous board member and managing director for its investor Javelin Venture Partners, explains that \\u201cThe CEOs that find themselves in this position but can\\u2019t do that simply run out of cash.\\xa0He made the correct decision that it was time to pivot. He didn\\u2019t waste time. He stopped spending money that didn\\u2019t need to be burnt, he kept a great culture over there, and I give him a ton of credit. The board was completely unanimous in how he went about this.\\u201d With a clean slate and years of runway in the bank, Newcomb went back to why he started Famo.us in the first place. He wanted to build mobile sites that were as powerful as mobile apps, and five years later, no one else has figured out how. So Newcomb took the JavaScript rendering engine and finally gave it a purpose: to make landing pages for advertisers that don\\u2019t require a daunting download like native apps, but are more seductive and functional that mobile sites. They\\u2019re called \\u201cInstant Apps.\\u201d To signify the\\xa0reboot from developer tool to software-as-a-service marketing cloud, Famo.us dropped the nerdy URL-style name, shifting to \\u201cFamous Industries.\\u201d And it kept one other thing too: the massive, gorgeous, hipster-minimalist penthouse office. No small startup should be able to afford it, but Newcomb got it for a steal because it used to be his apartment. When his neighbor and AngelList founder Naval Ravikant moved out, he bought that apartment too, tore down the dividing wall, and turned the sprawling steel and concrete palace into Famous HQ. The company builds Instant App templates that can be customized to embody the brand and desired features of different brands, like car makers, social media stars, fashion lines, movies and restaurant chains. They can host e-commerce purchases and checkout flows, video galleries, quizzes and more multi-media content. Newcomb and Barto break down the value of Famous\\u2019 Instant Apps into five points: Essentially, what Facebook did for news publishers with Instant Articles, Famous wants to take to the next level for marketers with Instant Apps. But instead of those experiences living inside a third-party platform like Facebook, they live on the open web with the brand in complete control. For $25,000, a brand can get a pilot Instant App built for them in a day. A year-long subscription to the Famous platform costs a couple hundred thousand dollars up into the millions, and lets marketers multiply different Instant App campaigns. The company\\u2019s goal is to lock down two flagship brands in each of 15 different industries. Famous hired 10-year Acxiom ad exec Geoff Amborn to head up sales. One recent e-commerce Instant App got sent out to 200 million people. Compared to the brand\\u2019s mobile web app, the Instant App saw conversion rates up 2X to 5X, with bounce rates down significantly.\\xa0While Famous wouldn\\u2019t tell me who they\\u2019re working with, a quick scan of its Twitter shows Kim Kardashian and her sister Khloe seem to have used Famous to sell their fashion lines. The Instant Apps basically take the celebrities\\u2019 Instagram photos and let you buy each item in their outfits. Famous isn\\u2019t the only one trying to speed up the web. Google has its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) standard and Facebook launched \\u201cCanvas,\\u201d which are effectively Instant Ads that live as in-app cached landing pages for its own News Feed ads. But tying your brand to a tech giant too big to care about what happens to anyone else\\u2019s business is risky. Plus, Facebook\\u2019s Canvas doesn\\u2019t live on the open web. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to trust the duopoly of Google and Facebook,\\u201d or the closed system of Apple, Newcomb warns. \\u201cWe want to be [the client\\u2019s] partner in a way that the big 5 mobile apps (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat) can never be. Not because they\\u2019re evil and we\\u2019re not, but because they\\u2019re platforms and we\\u2019re a third-party.\\u201d Famous will also have to race to stay in front of the standard capabilities of mobile browsers like Safari and Chrome. Luckily with Apple and Google so rooted in their walled garden native app stores, they have less incentive to make browsers better. He believes that by the time normal mobile sites and browsers can do what Famous does, it will be a step ahead, working on Instant Apps that can utilize your phone\\u2019s camera like native apps do. And\\xa0not every brand needs a permanent place in your phone. \\u201cHow many apps do you have on the home screen of your phone?\\u201d Katz asks. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to have a thousand.\\xa0Once brands do this I don\\u2019t see them going back, at\\xa0least not with their ad, social, and email campaigns.\\u201d Trying to fundamentally improve the web is wildly ambitious \\u2014 something most marketing cloud companies wouldn\\u2019t even attempt. But while it had to burn down the first iteration of the company, it emerged from the ashes with a technology powerful enough to fuel the next phase of its evolution. Sarah Faulkner, who was hired away from Google to be head of product,\\xa0says \\u201cI\\xa0joined Famous purely because of the huge opportunity. A\\xa0lot of companies are going after little niches, and Famous wants to change the way information is displayed on the internet.\\u201d Now it\\u2019s finally actually making money while minimizing burn. Newcomb expects to hit $5 million to $10 million in annual recurring revenue this year, with a burn rate of $15,000 per employee. Of the original team, Newcomb tells me \\u201cWe went through hell and back. They stood by me and I\\u2019m sure there are many times when I\\xa0would have fired me.\\u201d But now he\\u2019s clarified his mission, setting sights on further democratizing app development, even if that means squaring off with the juggernauts pushing a closed internet. Both the business plan and the Famous branding embody a tenuous balance between boldness and hubris. Newcomb concludes, \\u201cFamous has always been trying to hit a grand slam and we\\u2019re still trying. We\\u2019re either going to change the world or we\\u2019re going to do a gigantic face plant, and I wouldn\\u2019t want it any other way.\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'Chinese device maker Xiaomi has announced another clutch of mobile\\xa0hardware, including a concept smartphone developed\\xa0in collaboration with designer Philippe Starck. Xiaomi CEO and founder Lei Jun dubbed\\xa0it\\xa0\\u201ca glimpse at what the phone of the future looks like\\u201d. The near edgeless 6.4in, 17:9 display on the Mi Mix covers 91.3 per cent of the available surface area. So if you really hate bezels you\\u2019re going to be really smitten by this\\xa0vision of edgeless loveliness. Don\\u2019t get too excited, though. While the phone is due to go on sale in China early next month a Xiaomi spokesperson stressed there will be \\u201climited availability\\u201d \\u2014 and would not confirm how few phones that means. It is also unclear which other markets, if any, the device will be offered to. Xiaomi\\xa0has yet to bring any of its smartphones to the US \\u2014 although it continues to eye the market with interest . Perhaps even more so in the wake of Samsung\\u2019s problems with exploding batteries on the Note 7 . The\\xa0price-tag for the Mi Mix is\\xa0RMB 3499 (~$515), for a 4GB + 128GB \\u201cstandard version\\u201d.\\xa0The body of the phone\\xa0(back, sides, buttons) is made of ceramic. Inside there\\u2019s a 2.35GHz Snapdragon 821 processor, and a 4400mAh battery. There\\u2019s also an\\xa0even-more-limited-edition premium model\\xa0with extra\\xa0RAM and storage and 18-karat gold trim bling for RMB 3999. In order to maximize the screen-to-body ratio, Xiaomi notes that the Mi Mix does not have a physical earpiece speaker or a proximity sensor. Instead it\\xa0says it is\\xa0using piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology\\xa0\\u2014 specifically\\xa0a ceramic drive unit converts electrical signals into mechanical energy \\u2014 to allow audio without an earpiece speaker. The device also has an ultrasonic proximity sensor behind the display, replacing the traditional front-facing infrared proximity sensor.

       "  u'Only a month after Google expanded its home delivery service , Google Express , across a wide part of the Northeastern U.S., the company is today bringing its Amazon competitor to a number of new states in both the Southeast and Northwest. As of today, Google Express is launching in portions of Alabama, Kentucky, Utah, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. With these added regions, Google Express will now reach 70 million more people, the company says. Combined with the markets where the service was\\xa0already live, Google Express today covers\\xa0around 90 percent of the United States. The service aims to challenge Amazon, and in particular Amazon Prime Now, the online retailer\\u2019s same-day delivery service that\\u2019s live in major cities around the U.S. for Amazon Prime customers. What makes Google Express different is its retailer lineup. In most cases, it\\u2019s partnering with national retailers who either haven\\u2019t yet figured out e-commerce, or only offer\\xa0delivery through more traditional means \\u2013 not one-day delivery. While the retailers will vary by region, some of the brands working with Google include Costco, Whole Foods, Kohl\\u2019s, PetSmart, Sur La Table, Fry\\u2019s, Road Runner Sports, Walgreens, L\\u2019Occitane, Payless ShoeSource, and Guitar Center. One exception to that list, in terms of same-day delivery, would be Whole Foods \\u2013 the store\\xa0currently offers delivery through Instacart\\u2019s online grocery shopping service. But Google Express ditched its plans to delve into grocery delivery as part of a shift in strategy earlier this year. By distancing itself from\\xa0the more costly handling of fresh and frozen goods, the\\xa0company is able to take its service nationwide. The other key difference between Google Express and Prime Now is the pricing. While Amazon makes same-day delivery a perk for its Amazon Prime members, that requires customers to subscribe to Amazon\\u2019s $99 per year membership program. Google instead lets shoppers choose between buying a $95 annual membership, or paying a delivery charge of $5 (or more, at times.) Google Express shoppers also have to abide by store minimums, which are typically around $15 but can be as high as $35. Customers can place an order in Google Express, then choose their delivery window. Most orders can be delivered in one day, though not necessarily same day. Others will be delivered in two days, which means Google Express will also rival Amazon Prime. This, too, will vary by region. Google\\u2019s interest in entering online retail may seem curious, but it\\u2019s tied to the fact that Amazon has become the top destination for shopping searches. A recent survey found that more than half (55%) of U.S. online shoppers now begin product searches directly on Amazon, while search engines like Google and Yahoo saw declines. Only 28 percent are now starting shopping searches on Google, down from 34 percent the year prior. By year-end, Google says it plans to have the entire continental U.S. covered by Google Express.',\n",

       "  u'London\\u2019s iconic red phone boxes may be mostly gone from the streets of the city \\u2014 and many\\xa0of those that remain are no longer home to phones (one in my hood\\xa0is now a book exchange, another is a dingy mess) \\u2014 but the promise of offering communication services\\xa0to people on the go remains. Today, UK\\xa0carrier BT announced that it has partnered with Sidewalk Labs\\u2019 Intersection, the Google/Alphabet-backed startup\\xa0behind\\xa0New York\\u2019s LinkNYC free WiFi kiosks, to roll out LinkUK , free internet and phone hubs for\\xa0London and the rest of the country. As with its Big Apple counterpart, the plan is to provide people near the kiosks\\xa0with free WiFi (speeds of up to 1 Gigabit per second), along with free voice calls\\xa0and a few\\xa0other services \\u2014 which users can get through their own\\xa0WiFi-enabled devices or a tablet on the kiosk. Perhaps taking a tip from the NYC service, which found that unsavory types were congregating around the LinkNYC kiosks to browse porn, LinkUK will not provide unrestricted internet access as part of the deal. The partnership will be\\xa0a three-way affair in the UK between Intersection, BT and ad partner Primesight. Intersection is providing the kiosk architecture and technology for the service,\\xa0as part of its bigger ambition to take its business model to more markets and evolve it beyond being a pure moon shot . \\u201cAs a global hub for media and technology, London is the ideal city for Intersection to invest in the expansion of connectivity, digital innovation and our business,\\u201d\\xa0Dan Doctoroff, Chairman & CEO at Intersection and Sidewalk Labs, said. \\u201cLinkUK from BT will bring tremendous benefits to Londoners, visitors, local businesses, and international brands and we look forward to working with our partners, BT and Primesight, to transform this great city\\u2019s streetscape.\\u201d But while\\xa0Google itself has been making inroads into providing high-speed broadband services in the UK (note: some of that, it announced today, will now be paused ) , a spokesperson confirmed that it will be BT providing all of the connectivity for LinkUK. Lastly, the whole service will be underwritten by way of an advertising partnership with Primesight , an independent outdoor advertising network, which will run digital ads on the kiosks. As the kiosk rollout will start slow \\u2014 100 in the first phase, 750 in London longer-term \\u2014 Primesight has also cut a deal with BT to provide ads on an additional 17,500 older kiosks across the country. These will be in the form of non-digital vinyl display ads, a spokesperson said. BT declined to specify the financial terms of the deal except to say that BT, Intersection, and Primesight will all share in the ad revenues from LinkUK. Link UK, which is projected to start its rollout in 2017, has yet to get full approval from local authorities, the spokesperson said. But the Mayor of London\\u2019s office, as well as\\xa0Camden, the\\xa0first borough in London that will get the kiosks, have\\xa0already enthusiastically endorsed the project. In part, that\\u2019s because, with the rise of mobile phones, many existing phone boxes are hardly used for their original purposes anymore. Vandalised and worn out, they\\xa0are more\\xa0reminders of the seedier side of city life than communications hubs. \\u201cI welcome this exciting new addition to London\\u2019s streets. Expanding London\\u2019s digital infrastructure is a priority for the Mayor, and LinkUK can play a big part in improving connectivity for Londoners and visitors to our city, while reducing street clutter by upgrading and reducing the number of phone boxes,\\u201d said Rajesh Agrawal, London\\u2019s Deputy Mayor for Business, in a statement. \\u201cI look forward to working with BT, Intersection and Primesight to see how we can roll LinkUK across the capital, and to explore its future potential.\\u201d For BT, it\\u2019s also a useful way of trying to figure out how to shift some of these boxes \\u2014 which isn\\u2019t as straightforward as you might think to do , since they are considered a public service. \\u201cWe\\u2019re evolving the phone box to make it relevant in the 21st century by offering people ultrafast Wi-Fi and a range of digital and information services entirely for free. London is one of the greatest cities in the world and it\\u2019s entirely fitting that it becomes the first UK city to benefit from the\\xa0Links,\\u201d said\\xa0Gerry McQuade, CEO, BT Wholesale and Ventures.\\xa0But we will be rolling out many more\\xa0Links\\xa0to the other great cities across the UK over the coming months as we look to transform the look and functionality of our public payphones.\\u201d Today, there are a lot of existing free WiFi and hotspot services around the London and other urban areas, but bandwidth can be patchy and connections unreliable, and having the added bonus of free calling is\\xa0a useful addition. LinkNYC is an encouraging template for the impact that LinkUK might have. The company says that since it launched in January of this year, some\\xa0671,000 people have used WiFi from the kiosks, with some 34 million WiFI sessions and \\u201ctens of thousands of free phone calls\\u201d made every week.  Since LinkNYC launched in January, New Yorkers and visitors have embraced Link with more than 671,000 Wi-Fi users, 34 million Wi-Fi sessions, and tens of thousands of free phone calls made every week. \\u201cCities around the world look to New York for what\\u2019s next. We\\u2019re proud that LinkNYC has already helped nearly three quarters of a million people get online at super-fast speeds, and that excitement and adoption continues to spread,\\u201d said L inkNYC General Manager Jen Hensley. \\u201c Link \\u2019s expansion into London and the UK underscores how cities around the world are looking for ways to modernize their infrastructure to bring connectivity and digital services to their residents without burdening taxpayers. We\\u2019re excited to bring our valuable learnings from New York to London and help more people get connected.\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'Intellectual property theft may not be discussed as much as data breaches that see customers\\u2019 credit card and other personally identifiable information stolen by hackers. But online theft\\xa0of IP is a growing concern in tech, according to a new survey by Deloitte, Cyberattackers and Your Intellectual Property . That concern is even higher within the automotive industry, where 64% think it will increase in the next year, and the concern is highest within power and utilities where 69% think it will rise. Deloitte\\u2019s survey of more than 2,500 professionals encompassed banking and other financial services, retail, wholesale and distribution, travel and hospitality, insurance, Internet, IT and other tech companies. Of those surveyed, 32% admitted they didn\\u2019t even know if their own company had suffered IP cybertheft in the past year. Twelve percent said they had certainly suffered IP cybertheft. One-fifth of professionals suspected employees and other insiders would be most likely to steal IP online. In the automotive industry, one-third of tech professionals suspect cybertheft of IP would be an inside job. Only 10% of professionals thought cybertheft of IP would be most likely perpetrated by nation-states and only 12% thought it would be most likely perpetrated by activist organizations, despite the popularity of shows like Mr. Robot that popularize that idea. Intellectual property includes everything from drawings, plans, and employee training materials to a range of trade secrets, internal company know-how, research and development. Rather than any tangible asset, a majority of a company\\u2019s value these days is found in its IP, with rare exception. Across the S&P 500, companies\\u2019 total value consisted of 87% intellectual property and just 13% tangible assets in 2015, according to a report from Ocean Tomo , the IP merchant bank. Getting over IP theft involves figuring out what company secrets were accessed, by whom and when, where they may have been distributed, how a company, its customers and partners could be impacted by the IP theft, and explaining what happened to investors, while also figuring out what legal action to take, and how to tweak IP to regain a competitive advantage if one has been lost. For some tech startups, good IP is a deciding factor that leads venture investors to back them. It\\u2019s also, very often, the \\u201csecret sauce\\u201d that brings customers to buy from a startup and not an incumbent industry leader. Losing IP could be disastrous for early stage tech companies which typically don\\u2019t have legal protections such as patents granted, and trademarks secured, for everything they\\u2019re working on and releasing to the market. So if IP cybertheft actually does increase, startups could be among those most dramatically harmed.',\n",

       "  u'Shopify\\u2019s acquisition of Kit seemed like an intriguing move toward giving small shop owners more of the power of a fully staffed retailer, using virtual assistants to help supplement functions like marketing. Now, Kit\\u2019s automated marketing abilities are available to test out for merchants looking to see what the personable bot is capable of before they commit to \\u201chiring\\u201d the virtual helper. Shopify\\u2019s new Favors feature for Kit will let it create two Facebook ad campaigns and promote two Facebook social posts (you\\u2019ll still have to pay Facebook for the ads, of course) free of charge, and it\\u2019ll also send out your first five thank you emails to customers upon purchase. The idea is that it\\u2019ll basically work for shop owners for free up until it essentially makes five sales on your behalf. Kit founder Michael Perry explained in an interview that the purpose of doing this kind of trial, as opposed to a time-based free sampling of Kit\\u2019s service, was to help clearly demonstrate the marketing bot\\u2019s potential value for customers. Kit actually moved away from a free trial period to the new Favors model despite the success they were already seeing, Perry told me. \\u201cWe were converting at over 65 percent, from our trial users to paid customers, which, by industry standards is phenomenal,\\u201d Perry said. \\u201cWe feel very, very confident that that percentage actually will go up. The biggest fear that small business owners have is they\\u2019re actually skeptical out the gate that Kit even works.\\u201d Perry believes that by lowering the barrier so that there isn\\u2019t even a requirement to put credit card details on file will help convince even the skeptical hold-outs to give Kit a shot, and drive their conversion rate higher. It\\u2019s clear that Shopify sees virtual shop assistance as a big part of what it can offer small merchants, and it makes sense because it\\u2019s a product offering that still has value regardless of where the sales are actually happening, since it can work with various online store endpoints. Shopify uses a lot of anthropomorphism when talking about and marketing Kit, going so far as to pen its blog posts in first-person, and to use the word \\u201chire\\u201d to refer to its subscription options, which include a $10 per month basic plan and a $25 per month Kit Pro offering. It\\u2019s a key distinction that helps Kit distinguish itself from other marketing automation software, but the approach beneath is also more about helping merchants who otherwise wouldn\\u2019t look at that kind of offering realize its benefits. Using Shopify\\u2019s own logic, the new Favors approach is almost like an internship preceding a full hire, and it seems like a smart way to expand the reach of its shop-running bot further still.',\n",

       "  u'It\\u2019s clearly been a tumultuous couple of years for battery makers, now that simply not exploding is considered a feature \\u2013 but between the armies of hoverboards and some notable smartphone examples, well, it\\u2019s certainly worth a mention. Even beyond that,\\xa0the battery is all around one of the bigger selling points for the Immotor Go scooter \\u2013 due in no small part to the fact that the company was founded by former Mophie CEO Daniel Huang and a former XPal Power exec. Among the other claims for the \\u201cSuper Battery\\u201d is that it won\\u2019t explode when punctured and that the scooter is safe enough to take as a plane carry on (which, of course, is more up to the airlines and FAA than anyone). The company plans to roll out the technology for a number of other devices, but for now, the scooter is the focus. Aside from the battery tech, the little vehicle boasts some interesting features, including GPS tracking, a cruise control feature and autonomous following. It can also leverage the rider\\u2019s smartphone to control headlights, the horn and music playback via an on-board speaker. It will also let users capture video as they cruise along at top speeds of up to 19 miles an hour. The system weighs about 32 pounds with both batteries on board and has a range of up to 20 miles. Immotor will be taking preorders for Go and the higher-end (and action cam-sounding) Go Sport Pro via crowdfunding campaigns. via Engadget',\n",

       "  u'Launching today with a new security technology Uplevel Security wants to be the go-to tool IT departments use to respond to breaches and hacks. Founded by Roselle Safran,\\xa0the former branch chief for cybersecurity operations at the White House, Uplevel combines case management, threat intelligence management, workflow orchestration, and analytics to automate threat responses. The company is the culmination of years of work Safran conducted first as a consultant for Ernst & Young and then working in government for both the Department of Homeland Security and The White House. Uplevel\\u2019s security technology was born from Safran\\u2019s own needs. \\u201cThe team would end up going through all of these manual processes and sort of reinventing the wheel every time something was detected,\\u201d Safran said. With the help of fellow co-founder Elisabeth Maida, the two Princeton alums, developed a technology that could address the workflow after breaches or security threats had been detected. The company has been working with beta customers since 2014, and now counts Fortune 500 financial services companies among its early users. Companies deal with thousands of detection alerts every day and the security team needs to respond. \\u201cThere are a handful of incident response platforms and security response platforms that will touch on one or two of our capabilities,\\u201d Safran said. \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t seen anybody use graph analysis for the data and the actions that are taken.\\u201d Uplevel has raised $2.5 million in seed funding from First Round Capital and Aspect Ventures along with a host of individual angel investors.',\n",

       "  u'Another player in the packed p2p\\xa0payments space is announcing an $8.3 million Series A funding round today. SF and Barcelona based Verse is gunning to be the Venmo of Europe \\u2014 given Venmo hasn\\u2019t yet shown an\\xa0inclination to expand its mobile social payments app outside the US . The\\xa0Series A is led by Greycroft , with participation from Spark Capital , eVentures and Boost VC .\\xa0Verse had previously raised a $1.8M seed round from angel investors in Europe and the US. DFJ Dragon also invested in that round. The new funding will be used to expand its team, including new hires focused on product development, aimed at accelerating its growth,\\xa0says co-founder Alex Lopera. \\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to be like the WhatsApp of payments,\\u201d he tells TechCrunch. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really frustrating today when you want to do a transaction, when you want to pay back your friends, money that you owe them, and you don\\u2019t want to do online banking. It\\u2019s not something that\\u2019s cool or really works. \\u201cVerse is super slick and easy \\u2014 you just type the amount that you want to transfer, select one of your phone contacts from your address book, click send and the money\\u2019s already there.\\u201d It\\u2019s a mobile social\\xa0payments story\\xa0that\\u2019s amply familiar from multiple apps these day. And not just in the US:\\xa0in Europe other players here include the likes of France\\u2019s Lydia , Germany\\u2019s Cookies , US-based Circle , and N26 with its MoneyBeam offering , to name just a few. But as my TC colleague Romain Dillet succinctly puts it: \\u201cSocial payments is not a product; it\\u2019s just a feature\\u201d \\u2014 which is another way of saying\\xa0there\\u2019s a race on to see which of these startups\\xa0can scale fast enough to be the winner-takes-all network for Europe. After which they\\u2019ll be in a position to\\xa0monetize p2p usage\\xa0via\\xa0other banking features \\u2014 and even by becoming fully fledged banks ( N26 got its banking license this summer , for instance). Lopera touts Verse\\u2019s market footprint as an advantage vs competitors, noting it\\u2019s now in 16 European markets \\u2014 which does give\\xa0it greater reach than some rivals at this point, even as most of the competitive field here is\\xa0also thinking\\xa0outside one\\xa0local European market. Verse was actually incorporated in San Francisco, and went through a local accelerator there, before relocating most of its team to Barcelona\\xa0and soft launching the app this\\xa0February. It now has around 550,000 users across its Android and iOS footprint, according to Lopera, relying on viral spread rather than any substantial marketing spend at this point. He says the typical size of payment Verse users are pinging to each other via the app is between\\xa0\\u20ac25 and \\u20ac30. Verse\\xa0does not have banking partners in the various markets it covers\\xa0but rather holds customer funds in local bank accounts, settling euro transactions in markets where it does not have a local bank account via SEPA payments. (So, unsurprisingly, Lopera is hoping Brexit does not happen.) \\u201cWe think that there\\u2019s really no company today that has cracked the entire European market,\\u201d he adds. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve seen other companies launching products that are fairly local. We haven\\u2019t actually seen a player that\\u2019s operating in every major European country and actually has a sleek mobile app that works across countries. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a crowded space, a lot of people are interested in this space but we feel it\\u2019s a really big opportunity since there\\u2019s a lot that can be innovated in the payments industry\\u2026 There\\u2019s not really a winner yet, that is taking over Europe, in terms of social payments for Millennials. And that\\u2019s really what we\\u2019re going after.\\u201d What about the potential threat of a messaging giant such as\\xa0WhatsApp wading into p2p payments and sucking all the usage out of the room? WhatsApp\\u2019s parent Facebook does already offer p2p payments in Messenger in the US , for instance. \\u201cFor WhatsApp to release something like this, it\\u2019s going to take ages,\\u201d argues\\xa0Lopera. \\u201cJust take into account how long it took for them to launch WhatsApp calls. So\\u2026 \\u201d That doesn\\u2019t mean smaller\\xa0players here might not be future acquisition targets for messaging\\xa0network giants. Verse does not charge for p2p payments generally but if a user\\xa0wants to send\\xa0money between different European currencies \\u2014 such as the euro and the UK\\u2019s pound sterling \\u2014 it does charge a fee, of between 1.5 to 2 per cent \\u201cdepending on the country and the currency\\u201d. Verse\\xa0is using blockchain technology for\\xa0its main ledger system but not for moving money around (as some other payment startups, such as Circle \\u2014 which started life as a Bitcoin wallet \\u2014 are).',\n",

       "  u'Google, it seems, is still capable of surprising. A few weeks after launching a pair of handsets, a smart home hub and a virtual reality headset, the company is back with one of its most left-field hardware launches in recent memory. After all a big push into consumer mobile, the software giant is pursuing, of all things, the whiteboard. The Jamboard is an unlikely launch for the company, the product of a few years\\u2019 worth of development attempting to take the next step with its workplace tools. According to G Suite\\u2019s Director of Product, Jonathan Rochelle , the project was born out of a desire to build a new collaborative tablet interface for G Suite, the collection of business apps formerly known as Google Apps for Work\\u200e. \\u201cJamboard,\\u201d Rochelle explained, ahead of the unveil, \\u201cis the whiteboard now in Google Cloud.\\u201d It\\u2019s a 55-inch 4K touchscreen hub for workplace collaborations designed from the ground up. A director competitor to Microsoft\\u2019s Surface Hub built around Google apps. It\\u2019s a familiar sort of interface whose output lives in Google Drive, connecting to users in person or via smartphone or tablet using the company\\u2019s companion apps for iOS and Android (nope, no Windows yet). Google\\u2019s been testing the hardware with a number of high profile partners, including Netflix and Spotify, who have been trying it out in their own corporate boardrooms. The result is pretty impressive. Built from scratch (though the company has yet to name any hardware partners), it\\u2019s a fairly intuitive and extremely responsive interface. Users can draw with the include passive stylus and erase with their fingers (or an included eraser/microfiber). Tools like handwriting and shape help streamline the process and worked quite well in my own hands-on time with the product. The board also has 16 levels of pressure sensitive touch and nice little animations that bring small things like erasing to life, as you watch the text flake and fall off the display. The system runs on a highly specialized version of Android that features a built in browser and Google Maps among other features, along with opening it up to potential third-party apps. It also has Google Cast built in, so you can also use it as a big video display, complete with speakers that face down into the magnetic tray that holds the styli and eraser. The speakers, from what I heard aren\\u2019t great, but they\\u2019re plenty loud and will do the trick with teleconferencing audio. You can also just use the built-in Bluetooth to run it all through a speaker. As for why Google went with 4K here, beyond the occasional video watching, it says that the high res is necessary so as to avoid pixelation when you\\u2019re up close to the board. There\\u2019s also a built-in 2K camera capable of capturing telepresence at 60 frames per second. All of the collaboration occurs in real-time, making it possible to monitor the board on a mobile device with minimal latency. And once a project is finished, it can be shared with the team as a PNG or PDF. It\\u2019s also a surprisingly nice looking thing. The back of the board is lovingly sculpted, making it, quite probably, the nicest looking whiteboard I\\u2019ve ever seen. There are a couple of standard full USB ports back there, along with a USB C, HDMI and Ethernet. The board can be mounted to a wall or users can choose to buy the optional stand. All said, it should run less than $6,000 when it launches next year.',\n",

       "  u'When it comes to machine learning frameworks, Google\\u2019s Tensorflow is clearly the most popular option right now, but with CNTK , Microsoft also released its own internal framework at the beginning of the year. The company is launching the first beta of the next version (2.0) of CNTK\\xa0today and with it, it hopes to challenge Tensorflow\\u2019s leadership position. CNTK used to stand for \\u2018Computational Network Toolkit\\u2019 but the software has now been renamed to Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit instead. Xuedong Huang , Microsoft\\u2019s Chief Speech Scientist, told me that he believes CNTK/Cognitive Toolkit has always had plenty of advantages over Tensorflow and similar frameworks \\u2014 especially with regards to performance. According to Microsoft\\u2019s benchmarks, Cognitive Toolkit\\xa0continues to outperform its competitors in most tests and unsurprisingly, this new version is faster than the previous releases, especially when working on big data sets. That\\u2019s true for single-GPU performance, but Huang argues that what really matters is that CNTK\\xa0could already scale\\xa0up to using a massive number of GPUs and that\\u2019s obviously true for the new version as well. \\u201cIf you just work on a toy problem, other toolkits are enough, but if you want to scale out, CNTK is the only solution,\\u201d Huang argues. Speed isn\\u2019t always enough to capture developer mindshare. The first version of CNTK was essentially the same version Microsoft had used internally before and that meant developers had to write their code in C++ or C#. That seriously limited CNTK\\u2019s appeal, especially given that Tensorflow also allows developers to work in Python. Huang freely admits this. \\u201cWe prioritized internal efficiency \\u2014 and internally we\\u2019ve been using C++ all the time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe open-sourced the internal tool and shared that with the public.\\u201d What the team quickly realized once it released the software, though, was that developers were really looking for Python support. Knowing this, it\\u2019s no surprise that the Cognitive Toolkit will\\xa0natively support Python. In addition, the Cognitive Toolkit also now allows developers to use reinforcement learning to train their models. With Azure\\u2019s GPU instances now in beta, Microsoft can offer developers a full package of software tools and the hardware to run them on. Huang stressed that the Cognitive Toolkit isn\\u2019t bound to Azure in any way, though, and that Azure\\u2019s GPU instances will also work with other toolkits. Huang repeatedly stressed that Microsoft relies on the Cognitive Toolkit for a lot of its internal service and that it was the work on this project that allows Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research to get to a point where its software can now recognize words in a conversation as well as a person . It also forms the basis of some of the tools available through Microsoft\\u2019s Cognitive Services. The code is now available on GitHub .',\n",

       "  u'It\\u2019s time to check back in to what\\u2019s happening in the world of cryptocurrencies! Which\\u2014give it credit\\u2014is never, ever boring . Some things seem evergreen; the Bitcoin civil war is resurgent; the Ethereum\\u2019s growing pains continue. But out there on the horizon, some strange and interesting things are happening. I give you, for instance, appcoins, Blockstack, and Zcash. Appcoins Forget Bitcoin, say the appcoin true believers; forget Ethereum; heck, forget venture capital. Any project that can find a way to implement some time of internal cryptocurrency\\u2013an \\u201cappcoin\\u201d used to pay for goods or services within that project\\u2019s remit\\u2013can use that, first to crowdfund millions of dollars\\u2019 worth of initial development costs by selling \\u201cpre-mined\\u201d coins, then to share the rewards of success with those lucky / visionary initial users and investors. It sounds appealing! It has precedent; it\\u2019s exactly how Ethereum itself was funded, after all, and plenty of early Bitcoin enthusiasts got rich from that enthusiasm. You can see why blockchain enthusiasts unhappy with Bitcoin\\u2019s direction of late, such as Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, are so  excited about the idea. But \\u2014 totally aside from questions of whether this is technically legal \\u2014 like all crowdfunding, appcoins run the risk of questionable incentivization; \\u201cmake a lot of money up front\\u201d is a lot more tempting than \\u201cbuild something extraordinarily difficult and cutting-edge, and then see if there\\u2019s money in it,\\u201d as Bitcoin and Ethereum did. Appcoin poster child Steemit, for instance, provoked so much skepticism  they were reduced to posting \\u201c 7 reasons Steemit is not a Ponzi scheme \\u201d on their official blog. That\\u2019s never good. ETA: sooooo, this is embarrassing, but I somehow initially conflated a Steemit user post with their official blog above. Apologies for my sloppy confusion. My larger point holds, though\\u2026 More to the point, we\\u2019ve been here before; Ethereum isn\\u2019t just the second big blockchain, it\\u2019s the only one of many post-Bitcoin blockchains to have any real impact. So-called \\u201caltcoins\\u201d faded away because they were buggy, insecure, untrustworthy, and/or provided no lasting value beyond de facto gambling. As the always-interesting Preston Byrne, an attorney and co-founder of permissioned blockchain startup Monax, points out : Things aren\\u2019t quite the same now. (Also, MaidSafe isn\\u2019t really a cryptocurrency.) Today, appcoins are being woven into projects which use them as their internal currency, rather than simply existing for their own sake. But it\\u2019s still far from clear that we are moving into a world of many independent \\u201cappcoin\\u201d blockchains. In some especially technologically ambitious cases \\u2014 such as Ethereum \\u2014 a new appcoin / blockchain may be called for \\u2026 but absent such ambition, such an approach often smacks painfully of a solution searching for a problem. Appcoin caveat emptor. Blockstack What interests me most about cryptocurrencies is neither the \\u201ccrypto\\u201d nor the \\u201ccurrency\\u201d part. What interests me is that they are decentralized, permissionless services, which rely on \\u2014 and thus can be curtailed by \\u2014 no central controller. People say the Internet is about disintermediation, but in fact an astonishing amount of our online activity is conducted via the five Stacks: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. The notion of disintermediating them some \\u2014 now that\\u2019s interesting and disruptive. Hence my interest in decentralization technologies such as IPFS and, lately, Blockstack , a Union Square Ventures / Y Combinator startup which is trying to construct Which, as a software developer myself, sounds lovely, but also very much like one of those very many tools / frameworks which sound great until you get deep into their weeds, after which you ultimately realize that their technical limitations ultimately tend to cause more problems than they solve. Perhaps I am wrong; I hope I am wrong. Perhaps I am being reflexively cynical because it sounds so exciting. Perhaps we shall see when its browser emerges from public beta. That browser, as I understand it, builds web pages out of decentralized data stored by individual users, in Dropbox or similar services, without any central servers being required. What\\u2019s more, it would use blockchain (Bitcoin\\u2019s) for domain registration, something I\\u2019ve been calling for for a long time. \\u201cAll of this, by the way, also makes building websites easier,\\u201d enthuses The Observer . As a frequent website builder, I remain skeptical until I see the details. But I am hopeful. Which is also how I feel about Zcash which also just launched , and which I\\u2019ve been looking forward to for some time. It\\u2019s another cryptocurrency, but it\\u2019s not just another cryptocurrency: to quote, er, myself , it This is pretty remarkable. And I know I just spent a paragraph waxing skeptical about new blockchains, but Zcash is \\u2014 like Ethereum was \\u2014 a fundamental technological advance, not just a new project using the same technology. The prospect of truly anonymous transactions may sound alarming to some, but in a world in which privacy withers further away every day, it can also sound a lot like a reassuring bulwark. More prosaically, to quote founder and OG cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox in this great IEEE piece about Zcash: Wilcox sounds appropriately inspirational : \\u201cI want to be able to say we were there, pushing for that great transformation that began to wash away the suffocating mass of inefficiency, corruption, and isolation \\u2014 the transformation that unlocked the potential of billions of humans who had been trapped behind walls \\u2014 cooperation boundaries!\\u201d And, encouragingly, ZCash paid for a pre-launch security audit , which will hopefully help them avoid some of the roadblocks that Ethereum has hit. \\u2026Of course, once again, when you get into the weeds, you always find skeptics with coherent arguments. Here\\u2019s one touting its competitor Monero, which uses ring signatures rather than zk-SNARKs to anonymize transactions. But the weirdest and most cinematic thing about ZCash is not abstruse arguments about relative efficacy: it\\u2019s the esoteric ceremony with which it had to be initiated, after which occult secrets had to be destroyed. No, seriously. An unavoidable side effect of the math is (to oversimplify) when the ZCash blockchain is initially set up, it is possible for its originators to retain \\u201csecret keys\\u201d that will allow them to anonymously create and spend new counterfeit ZCash whenever they like. ZCash itself calls these secret keys \\u201c toxic waste ,\\u201d and they report that last week they went through a mathematically and physically elaborate ceremony in which the network was initiated and the \\u201ctoxic waste\\u201d was then destroyed. Their blog post explaining this is both deeply surreal and truly awesome. Does the world possibly want to adopt a currency whose viability fundamentally requires this to have happened? \\u2026I don\\u2019t know! (The parameters can be swapped out, if believed compromised, but how can you guarantee the next set of parameters?) Still, regardless of whether ZCash as currently enacted will become an economic force, I am bullish on its technology; it is a major and impressive next step towards guaranteed privacy and, therefore, all \\u2013 important  fungibility . oh my! Back in the cryptocurrency mainstream, if there is such a thing, the Big Two blockchain ecosystems of Bitcoin and Ethereum have been awfully busy as well. Ethereum hard-forked, again , to deal with an attacker targeting its security flaws, again! ( Told you so .) The Bitcoin community is at war with itself , again! \\u2026Also, beyond the sturm und drang, a lot of interesting stuff is happening. Blockcerts, \\u201can open standard for digital academic certificates on the Bitcoin blockchain\\u201d from the MIT Media Lab, has launched . In a world awash in fake credentials, this looks like it could take off. Meanwhile, as banks and big companies dip their toes into the blockchain pool, the \\u201c first global trade between two independent banks using blockchain and smart contract technologies \\u201d has finally been completed. They\\u2019ll have to move a lot faster than that, though, if they hope to keep up with today\\u2019s pace of change.',\n",

       "  u'MasterCard account holders will soon be able to check on their accounts, track their spending, review past purchases and more right in Facebook Messenger. That\\u2019s right \\u2013 MasterCard is the latest company to embrace Facebook\\u2019s chatbot platform as a new means of interacting with its customers in an automated, but A.I.-enhanced way. The company announced its plans at the Money 20/20 conference this week. The bot itself is powered by Kasisto\\u2019s conversational A.I. platform KAI, a spin-off from SRI International. (SRI, as you may know, was also home to Siri before Apple acquired it.) With the bot, customers will be able to ask a number of questions about their accounts, as well as set spending alerts, learn about their cardholder benefits,\\xa0and receive offers through the MasterCard Priceless Experiences\\xa0program \\u2013 its local deals initiative. The new bot is currently in pilot testing, but the company says it will roll out to all of Facebook Messenger\\u2019s 1 billion users, starting early next year, in the U.S. first. In addition, MasterCard also detailed its MasterCard bot for merchants, will allow online shoppers make purchases on messaging platforms, like Facebook Messenger. Later this year, merchant partners will be able to access MasterCard\\u2019s Bot Commerce API to start testing\\xa0MasterCard integration in their own chatbots, says the company. MasterCard is not alone in embracing bot-based commerce. Though it\\u2019s unclear that consumers themselves have warmed to the idea of interacting with virtual assistants for online shopping and account management, that hasn\\u2019t seemed to slow companies down from developing for the various messaging platforms.

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/29/what-product-development-teaches-us-about-self-improvement/',\n",
       "  u' While the digital revolution has brought with it many conceptual changes, one of the most pronounced is that of the version release. Your phone is considered outdated if it\\u2019s a year old, and obsolete if you bought it three years ago. Whenever you connect to Wi-Fi your apps undergo a version update. The Facebook you\\u2019re using today is not the same version you posted to last week. Tesla cars run version releases overnight. And software is updated regularly \\u2014 just as you manage to wrap your head around the latest iPhone UI, a new version is out. Chock-full of new features! A new interface! New functionality! Products are not the only ones prone to constant change and improvement. So are work processes (e.g. from waterfall to scrum), team dynamics, organizational structures and business functions. In Japan, the concept of kaizen \\u2014 literally, \\u201cchange for the better\\u201d \\u2014 has been applied to the workplace, referring to activities that continuously improve all functions and involve employees from the CEO to assembly-line workers. It is a concept now deeply embedded in the collective consciousness \\u2014 and it can\\u2019t help but filter into the realm of the self. Self-improvement is nothing new. All religions call for personal development, as did the ancient Greek and Roman techniques of epimeleia. Aristotle was all for it, as was Confucius. But never have these ideas turned into such a sprawling industry as in the age of version releases. Self-help, coaching, fitness, beauty enhancement, workshops and motivational speaking are all aligned to bring out the next version release of you. The pressure to improve and evolve has never been greater. But the crux of the matter is that improvement is easier said than done: It demands both a will and an ability to change, but also a strong enough backbone as to not lose your identity or sway to the wind of every passing buzz. And it demands an ability to cope with the fallout of change, because moving things around often uncovers a weak underbelly. But most of all, it requires you to take honest stock of where you are and where you want to go. Not to mention the stamina to work your way through the obstacles that surely will come. Eventually, I heeded my dad\\u2019s advice and hired a developer. The thing is, I never let him go. On the contrary: I hired more developers and product people, who have since released the first version of our software, and then improved on that for version 2.0 and have been going on ever since, soon to release version 5.0 to our growing cadre of more than 200 clients. In the interim, there were dozens of smaller releases, coming out monthly, and a constant buzz of ongoing version updates. Along the way, I also released new versions of myself: versions better able to cope with change, better adapted to the turbulence inherent in building and running a startup on three continents, and, as life demanded, better suited for marriage and fatherhood. And I did this by implementing in the realms of the self the hard lessons I learned from my work in product. Here they are, in a nutshell: Rely on user feedback. Product teams look for new features to build based in part on user feedback. In the context of interpersonal relationships, we often tend to scoff at criticism or negative feedback, but those are actually golden opportunities for growth. Just as developers sometimes have blind spots concerning the product, or misunderstandings regarding the ways people will be affected by different features, so do we as individuals regarding ourselves. We should seriously and open-heartedly listen to feedback from those around us (co-workers, friends, family) to identify areas for self-improvement. Set deadlines. Similarly, product teams are typically held to deadlines. The optimization they\\u2019re looking for is not some vague idea, to be considered when the time is right. Deadlines demand a serious, concentrated effort that yields results, and is a great tool for focusing. In the same vein, people should set their own deadlines for self-improvement. Goal setting is a crucial element in both product and personal improvement. Identify unique differentiators. Products are also often created or updated to fill holes in the marketplace with a unique differentiator. This demands an understanding of the product\\u2019s identity, of what needs development and, no less important, what not to develop. This same idea could apply to people too, especially in the workplace, where employees should look around and identify what no one else in their company is doing and then build the skills and expertise to help their company succeed in a certain area.\\xa0And it is no less relevant in a social and interpersonal context. Go agile. As you progress with the methodology of your self-improvement, the tenants of \\u201cagile marketing\\u201d can also come in handy. For example, develop small, incremental releases and iterate. This is a very optimistic concept for personal development: The goal you\\u2019re aiming at doesn\\u2019t need to happen in full tomorrow morning. It\\u2019s enough that you take small steps toward it, one after the other, to ensure that you will get there eventually. Soon after my son was born I realized that version releases are actually built in to human development. It was as though he was releasing a new version of himself daily, with a major release every couple of months: The first smile \\u2014 a killer feature! The roll over \\u2014 an audience grabber! The first step \\u2014 now more user-friendly than ever! And in order to do this he was relying on user feedback, sticking to hard-coded deadlines, carving out his unique differentiation and running the most agile show in town. This age of the version release carries with it a trade-off. On the one hand, nothing is ever finished, everything is temporary and the new quickly becomes outdated. Staying relevant is becoming ever harder. On the other hand, it carries the sweet and hopeful promise for betterment. There will always be the next version release \\u2014 of your favorite app, of that annoying bug in the software, of the camera on your phone \\u2014 and, if you work hard enough, even of you. What is the essence of human life but continuously striving to become the best version of yourself, ultimately achieving your full potential?',\n",

       "  u'When Lume Cube first crashed into the world\\u2019s consciousness, they did so with an $80 smartphone-controlled, waterproof light aimed at the GoPro-loving extreme sports market. Today, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign for Life Lite, its followup.\\xa0Life Lite is 33 percent less bright, but also half the price\\xa0and half the size. The new addition is aimed at people shooting live video with smartphones. \\u201cWe hoped this was going to be successful,\\u201d said Lume Cube\\u2019s founder and CEO Mornee Sherry in an interview last week. \\u201cAnd the original Lume Cube is now available for sale in more than 45 countries.\\u201d The original Lume Cube became a darling of extreme sports fans all over the world, but the cube-shaped light was too big and too pricey for some of the company\\u2019s customers.

The photographic landscape has changed a lot since 2014, however: The number of people filming and streaming with their smartphones has gone through the roof. Small cameras are much happier in low light than they used to be, and the relentless focus on indestructibility is less important to the current generation of filmmakers.

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/29/blockchain-is-empowering-the-future-of-insurance/',\n",
       "  u' The embers of innovation are beginning to char the massive $1.2 trillion underbelly of the largest industry in the world. Every segment of insurance is under competition by entrepreneurs touting new ways to underprice risk, creating new types of premiums and servicing consumers in a tightly regulated on-demand economy. While most startups attempting to gain traction in the insurance market fall under incremental innovation, Blockchain for insurance could be characterized as disruptive. The underlying technology of the world\\u2019s most adopted digital currency, bitcoin, is quickly becoming one of the hottest topics across a number of industries. More than just a distributed database for bitcoin, Blockchain\\u2019s ability to send, receive and store information has the underlying power to disrupt the way businesses process digital transactions. The implications of decentralized ledger technology (DLT) are astounding: Digital trust is now an ever reasonable possibility; meaning online and offline assets can now be assigned ownership and the transference between those parties can be proven both linearly and cryptographically. Specific to insurance, Blockchain technology has the power to simplify the claims process, alleviate high premiums, help insurers create niche coverage and, most importantly, benefit those who live in catastrophe regions. Blockchain adoption has the power to transition new and existing models of insurance, including P2P insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance, into a new digital age. Blockchain is powerful because of its secure platform connecting capabilities. New distribution methods like peer-to-peer insurance (P2P) could end up restructuring the entire market. P2P insurance empowers policyholders to a greater portion of the premiums rather than the individual private wealth managers working to produce returns for insurance companies. A number of well-funded startups are already beginning to stake their place in the P2P insurance market. One example, Dynamis , is a peer-to-peer supplemental unemployment insurance protocol that uses the policy holders\\u2019 social capital to replace underwriters. Enigma , enables different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping the data completely private. In the foreseeable future, specific P2P insurance platforms may begin to use smart contracts to set claims and match demand between consumers in an online market, solving many of the current issues when transferring digital assets or accessing private data. Another use case for Blockchain is parametric insurance. Instead of indemnifying the pure loss, insurers would agree to pay a certain amount upon the occurrence of triggers within preset smart contracts. For example, if an earthquake were to occur in a given region above a magnitude of 5, the smart contract would automatically pay 20 percent of the insurance claim to policy holders. Contracts require mutually trusted third-party administrators (TPAs) to adjust. As parametric insurance becomes popular, its process will likely improve to play a key role in the widespread adoption of smart contracts. Product-creating startups like Rainvow can be used to create cross-border risk pools, allowing individuals from all over the world to access its exchange protocol via digital currencies. Rainvow\\u2019s Ethereum platform facilitates niche coverages to automatically compensate unforeseen transportation costs on rainy days. Platform-creating startups like Factom * facilitate highly specific insurance policies. These systems allow TPAs to create triggers or oracles for smart contracts, promising to make parametric insurance easier and more adoptable by insurance carriers. The fast growth of IoT-based technologies and sensors have fueled startups and corporations, giving access to real-time data that may ultimately give way to new methods of settling insurance disputes. Automobiles could be assigned tokens by their manufacturers; rather than having the incident go through an insurance company, vehicles could adopt tech for cars to assess driving accidents automatically. A fender-bender would trigger instant compensation within the smart contract based on sensor and party data. Blockchain has several perceived benefits in microinsurance, as well. It can enable trust between peers to increase transparency for populations living in remote regions of the world. Its beauty lies in its simplicity. The virtual nature of the transactions could side-step governmental bureaucracy to make geographic limitations irrelevant within its context. These features make the future of microinsurance very appealing. Helperbit , an Italian Blockchain startup, uses the Blockchain protocol to enable philanthropists to donate digital currencies to underfunded, hard to reach nonprofits in remote regions of the world. It even allows people to trace their donation and the manner in which it is used. Their risk assessment platform allows Good Samaritans to pool their money while limiting fraud exposure. Blockchain allows for cheaper, more consumer-oriented products to be developed that could chip away at the premiums collected by large insurance companies. An ideal scenario would be the cooperation between Blockchain startups, carriers, brokers, reinsurers, etc. However, most likely many segments of the insurance industry will be subject to disruption and may follow the way of milk men or lamplighters\\u2026 a precautionary tale for incumbents in the insurance industry. *Factom is a portfolio company.',\n",

       "  u' \\u201cYou have to know the past to understand the present.\\u201d \\u2013 Carl Sagan 2016 is a watershed moment for the recruitment industry. LinkedIn and Monster are being acquired, and CareerBuilder is for sale \\u2014 three of the highest-profile tech companies in the space. Microsoft is making a grand entrance, while cashed-up incumbents watch closely from the sidelines. The ripples will span the entire industry \\u2014 from founders, investors and service providers to job seekers. Basically everyone in business. How will it impact you? This article brings clarity through a historical lens. It provides a framework for how the industry has evolved over the past 20 years, to help founders, investors and practitioners understand and navigate the biggest trends currently underway. Recruitment is an attractive target for disruption \\u2014 hundreds of billions spent every year, with inefficient business models and widely felt pain. But despite thousands of startups taking billions in investment, the truly structural innovations can be mapped on a single page. And the fundamental workflow of recruiting has remained remarkably resilient to technical change. Today, like 20 years ago, we still source candidates, put them through a process of interview and selection and need someone to manage that process. The framework below maps the most important shifts across three distinct periods of innovation. The arrows show the \\u201cdirection\\u201d of innovation, from which new models emerge. For example, job aggregators (like Indeed ) emerged in the mid-2000s to disrupt online job boards. This framework generalizes the recruitment value chain and ignores thousands of startups and innovations that haven\\u2019t had widespread impact. And the emergence of a new model doesn\\u2019t make a previous one redundant (e.g. job boards are widely used today) \\u2014 but it does provide context for when and how many well-known companies have emerged. Before diving in, observe that innovation over the past 20 years has been horizontal (left to right), and constrained within specific steps in the value chain. That\\u2019s all changing in 2016. First, let\\u2019s take a look at the defining models and companies that have shaped each step in the value chain, before examining the biggest trends shaping the industry today. We\\u2019ve simplified it into three understandable steps \\u2014 find the candidates, track the process, then do the process.  In the beginning there were newspapers. If you wanted to find candidates, you paid for an ad in a physical newspaper. Simple, effective and expensive. Hello, internet. Wave 1: Online job boards.  Online job boards emerged in the late-1990s to steal eyeballs from newspapers and print media. The defining companies of this era were Monster , CareerBuilder and Craigslist \\u2014 completely reshaping the job advertising and search experience for both employers and job seekers. Despite becoming obvious targets of disruption, job boards still contribute 10-15 percent of hires in the U.S. Wave 2: Active versus passive sourcing. In the mid-2000s, social networks split the market into categories of active and passive candidates . Job boards were for active candidates, but they were limited to traffic they could earn or buy. Then Indeed found it easier to aggregate ads from other websites, and introduced \\u201cpay-per-click\\u201d job advertising. Job aggregation became the dominant model for active sourcing \\u2014 Recruit Co. acquired Indeed in 2012 and drives 58 percent of external hires in the U.S. But the defining company of this period was LinkedIn . It created a new category for passive sourcing by bringing profile data online. Now anyone could search for potential candidates, whether they had applied to a job or not. Previously, recruiters had an information arbitrage over employers, thanks to their \\u201cproprietary\\u201d databases. No more. Candidate data became free to anyone with the tools and skill to find it. Wave 3: Employer branding and sourcing tools. The job board model was soon attacked by a different source of data \\u2014 company reviews . Glassdoor crept onto the scene, applying lessons from Expedia and Yelp on the power of user-generated content. It quickly added an Indeed-style aggregator to become the fastest growing job site, visited by nearly 50 percent of U.S. job seekers at some point during their search. Meanwhile, passive sourcing became recognized as a distinct activity within recruiting, supported by an entire category of new tools and technology. The biggest innovations in this period are people search engines that aggregate profile data from across the web \\u2014 e.g. Connectifier (acquired by LinkedIn), TalentBin (acquired by Monster) and dozens of others still fighting for share.  The applicant tracking system (ATS) is the CRM of recruiting. Most companies are stuck using old, ugly technology they need but don\\u2019t like. Wave 1: On-premise ATS. The ATS emerged as a distinct category of software in the 1990s. Like most software in that period, it was installed on a customer\\u2019s server, and focused on enterprise companies. The defining company of this period was Taleo , which successfully navigated the move to SaaS (in Wave 2) and was acquired by Oracle for $1.9 billion. It still dominates the market with 36 percent share . Wave 2: The move to SaaS. In the early 2000s a new category of \\u201cweb-first\\u201d ATS emerged, in line with the general trend to SaaS. New players gained share, including Jobvite and iCIMS . This wave also saw consolidation, with enterprise incumbents Oracle and SAP seeking to establish full suites of HR software. Wave 3: The new breed. Then expectations changed. Enterprise software needed to be effective and sexy. A new breed of ATS emerged \\u2014 user-friendly, mobile-first, open to integrations and free of technical debt. In the last few years more than $100 million of investment has flowed to new players, including Greenhouse , Lever , SmartRecruiters and Workable . It remains a brutally competitive space, and the winners will combine product innovation with aggressive marketing and sales.  Despite 20+ years of technical innovation, most money in talent acquisition is still spent on recruitment service providers \\u2014 both external and internal. The popular notion of \\u201cdisrupting recruiters\\u201d has merit, but misses three important factors: (a) someone needs to use the tools and manage the process, whether external or internal; (b) there is huge fragmentation and range of service providers; and (c) the recruitment services industry itself has seen major innovation and disruption. Wave 1: \\u201cGold rush\\u201d for agency recruiters. The 1990s through to the mid-2000s were a gold rush for agency recruiters . Proprietary databases gave them an information arbitrage, and they could charge employers a premium. The industry was flooded with all manner of folk looking to strike it rich. Many agencies were sales-intensive environments with few rules; owners became rich, and some went as far as listing public companies. Wave 2: Internal and RPO. The hangover began in the mid- to late-2000s with two conflicting trends. First, the popularity of LinkedIn and other technologies empowered many companies to reduce spend on external recruiters and manage the process internally. This period saw a major trend toward corporate recruiting teams. Many agency recruiters made the shift to an internal environment. They still \\u201cdid\\u201d recruiting, just for a single company, often in a more stable environment. Second, recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) emerged as large employers realized they could get the benefits of an internal team \\u2014 at lower cost \\u2014 by outsourcing their entire recruiting function. Early players were acquired by incumbents \\u2014 e.g.\\xa0Sourceright ( Randstad ), TheRightThing ( ADP ). Today\\u2019s standalone leaders have attracted significant investment from private equity \\u2014 e.g. Cielo (KKR), WilsonHCG (Frontier Capital). RPO is currently a $3-4 billion industry growing at 10 percent per annum, but is generally restricted to high-volume employers due to high costs of delivery. Wave 3: Specialization and independents. Over the past five years, technical innovation has trickled down to reshape the profession of recruitment. Specialist sourcers , focused on the technical activity of candidate identification and outreach, have emerged as a category distinct from recruiters. In parallel, independent contract recruiters have blurred the lines between internal and external. Independent recruiters (and sourcers) now have more options to work for themselves, using new tools and platforms, under a variety of pricing models (e.g. hourly, project-based, success-based). This has benefited employers by reducing cost and increasing flexibility. 2016 is a watershed moment with many of these trends converging. The next wave is coming \\u2014 will it be a period of consolidation, innovation or both? Here are four shocks already underway, along with questions that will shape the industry for the next decade or more. Microsoft has aggressively entered the space with its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. Integration will take time, but will have far-reaching implications across the industry. Will this open the doors for other major entrants? We know companies like Salesforce, Google and Facebook were interested in LinkedIn , and that Salesforce in particular has a longstanding interest in HR tech. Is Microsoft\\u2019s entry likely to dampen or increase those ambitions? Then there are the \\u201cforgotten\\u201d giants of Oracle, SAP and IBM, with deep pockets, major horses in this race and a risk of falling behind the next wave of innovation in recruitment technology. How could these companies or others find ways to enter the space? Randstad (No. 2 recruitment services company globally) is acquiring Monster, to support its goal of building the world\\u2019s most comprehensive portfolio of HR services. This isn\\u2019t the first big example of vertical integration \\u2014 after Recruit Group (Japanese conglomerate) acquired Indeed \\u2014 but could be the most impactful given the potential for integration. Vertical integration is also happening in other areas; for example: Incumbent job boards investing in steps beyond the job posting: Mixed models emerging, blending technology and services: ATS providers expanding and integrating with an aim of owning the entire recruiting workflow. How will incumbent service providers or traditional models respond to vertical integration? While the top end is consolidating and integrating, the number of startups focused on recruitment technology has exploded. It has never been easier or cheaper to start a tech company, and the industry has been flooded with founders and new investment chasing the next big thing. Many of these new startups feel like features more than businesses, and will pivot or disappear. For practitioners and potential customers, it\\u2019s more difficult than ever to cut through the noise and understand which new technology can truly impact your hiring process. What will be the next breakout technologies and innovations to scale? Traditional service providers \\u2014 recruiters, sourcers, executive search consultants \\u2014 face pressure on margins as they compete against tech-enabled solutions. Many are adapting to different pricing and business models. The best will continue to specialize by industry, geography and stage of the hiring process. Generalist providers will struggle. Incumbents that don\\u2019t make bold moves will be left behind. In an environment of technical consolidation and increasing competition on the ground, many will exit the industry or simply perish. How can incumbent service providers differentiate to maintain margins and stay relevant? This article does not propose answers to any of these questions. The intention was to frame the historical context and biggest trends currently driving the industry. The only prediction is that 2016 will be remembered as a watershed year in recruitment services and technology. How will it impact you?',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/youtube-presidential-debates-were-the-most-watched-political-live-streams-ever/',\n",
       "  u'YouTube\\u2019s airing of the U.S. presidential debates via news organizations\\u2019 live streams have clocked in as the most-viewed political live streams of all time, the company says. That\\u2019s not surprising, given the growing number of cord cutters, the international attention the debates have garnered, and the fact that, generally speaking, political live streams aren\\u2019t always\\xa0this\\xa0entertaining. (Well, if your definition of entertainment involves watching the debacle that has become American politics.) That being said, the numbers for the third and final presidential debate were up slightly from the prior one, with 2.8 million \\u201clive watch hours,\\u201d compared with the second debate\\u2019s over 2.5 million. However, it was down a bit from the first debate\\u2019s 3 million live watch hours. These numbers don\\u2019t necessarily speak to audience interest in the political streams, though, as the debates, at times, have had to compete with other large televised event, like NBC\\u2019s Sunday Night Football, for example. YouTube also says that the third debate saw 1.7 million live peak concurrent viewers, again an increase over the second debate , which had over 1.5 million peak concurrents. But this was down from debate #1, with its nearly 2 million peak concurrents. Still, the third debate\\u2019s numbers are up from the same event in 2012, with peak concurrents 4 times higher than the last presidential election, and live watch hours 5 times higher than in 2012. Combined, there were over 140 million views on all debate-related videos for this third debate, says YouTube. That\\u2019s up from 124 million for the second debate, and more than the 88 million for the first. Keep in mind this figure for \\u201cdebated-related videos\\u201d represents more than the live streamed events \\u2013 anything that features the debates is fair game here. Also remember that these numbers, while growing over previous years, can\\u2019t be compared directly with TV ratings. Traditional television is still where the majority of Americans are watching: Nielsen reported the final debate pulled in an estimated 71.6 million viewers , which was below the numbers from the first debate (a record 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates); but the third debate on TV also clocked in as the third-largest total ever recorded by Nielsen, since it began collecting viewership numbers for these events back in 1976. If anything, YouTube\\u2019s metrics, in part, point to the growing numbers of people who watch online video \\u2013 a figure which has been climbing over the years , and especially on YouTube \\u2013 as well international interest in the current election. Searches for U.S. election content are up 547 percent compared to the last race, the company noted. After the U.S., the top countries viewing the third debate live were Canada, the U.K., Mexico and Australia. What\\u2019s interesting, too, about how the debates play out on YouTube is that many viewers don\\u2019t watch these events end-to-end. According to YouTube figures, on average, viewers watched the three debates for 22 minutes. Whether that figure can be attributed to online viewers\\u2019 shorter attention spans or a collective\\xa0inability to stomach the entire event is, well, still debatable.

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/facebooks-news-feed-just-got-better-on-slower-connections/',\n",
       "  u'Facebook\\u2019s News Feed has now been made even better for users with slow network connections \\u2013 a project the social network has been working on for some time by revamping its underlying architecture to improve the way stories are ranked and displayed in the Facebook mobile application. With the latest series of improvements , Facebook will select which stories to show you\\xa0based on a combination of pre-cached stories saved on the device, as well as new stories from Facebook\\u2019s servers. The update will also introduce the ability for Facebook to re-rank this combination of News Feed stories directly on the client \\u2013 something that\\u2019s possible now because of the increased computing power of\\xa0today\\u2019s mobile devices. This change, explains the company, will better ensure that users are seeing the most relevant News Feed story, even when they\\u2019re on a slow connection. That means fewer spinners and gray boxes, Facebook says. Facebook has been working to make its service more accessible in\\xa0emerging markets where connection speeds are often slower or inconsistent as part of its ongoing effort to reach the \\u201cnext billion users.\\u201d The company a year ago rolled out a series of News Feed tweaks, which included things like caching stories on the device in order to have something to show you rather than a blank page. It also previously had begun\\xa0to prioritize the items you\\u2019re actively looking at, while deprioritizing those your current connection couldn\\u2019t handle, like videos. In the past, however, the way Facebook\\u2019s News Feed worked is that the server would send a batch of already ranked stories to the client. Those that weren\\u2019t displayed would be\\xa0cached so they could be shown in a pinch when your\\xa0connection dropped or slowed. But the problem with this system is that this could lead to people seeing older and less relevant content, since they weren\\u2019t getting newer stories from the server. That might be fine in cases where there\\u2019s absolutely no connection, but not necessarily the best way to handle things when the connection is just slower than usual. Now, Facebook will figure out what to show you next by looking\\xa0at both this cache of older stories on the client as well as a pool of new stories from the server. That is, every time the server sends the client a new story, it can automatically be ranked in the News Feed alongside those unseen stories from the persistent cache. And this process happens every time you scroll down, even on poorer connections. The end result of these changes is that Facebook will better display the stories that have been optimized for your current network connection, at the time of your session. Because it can now re-rank stories on the client, that means it can do things like temporarily downrank a media-heavy story that includes\\xa0photos, videos or link previews, for example. When the associated media loads \\u2013 images, at least the beginning of the video, or\\xa0the text of the Instant Article \\u2013 only then will it be displayed to the end user. The update is one of many things that Facebook has been\\xa0doing to make its app work better on poor connections, or when you\\u2019re offline.\\xa0Last December, for example, it began allowing users\\xa0to comment on posts when offline . Before that, it allowed for offline sharing and Likes. And the company has even specifically designed a \\u201cLite\\u201d version of its mobile app that uses less data for those on 2G networks or with unstable internet connections. Facebook notes the new changes won\\u2019t only benefit emerging markets, however \\u2013 everyone experiences poor connections at times, and this will help in those cases, too.',\n",

       "  u'These days you tend to hear about Russia in terms of its government hacking the US election. But some canny Russian developers have put their skills to something more productive: monitoring the TV appearances of world leaders. A team of Russian developers have released an AI powered algorithm that tracks all world leaders activities in all media. Based on the information the Verso service analyzes the impact of each President/Prime Minister and shows a rating for them in real-time. Verso is an experiment to utilise algorithms designed to rapidly recognise faces (even blurry ones) which were developed at Moscow State University, Once a second the Verso platform takes a screenshot of a set of monitored TC channels. All the faces it detects are run through the computer vision processing, to see if there is one which matches the person the researchers are searching for. The algorithms it uses are able to tell in milliseconds if a person is at least a 99% match, even with blurred or turned heads. The data it delivers to its site is in real-time. Spokesman Eugene Gordeev, a managing partner at Russian Ventures, says: \\u201cSince we are just experimenting with AI and tweaking the system, some data may not be representative and gives only picture of relativity, that why we called it a project \\u2013 Verso!\\u201d There\\u2019s live coverage here to demonstrate the software on 20 channels Here\\u2019s an example of how the project looked at the second debate between Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. Trump is very active at the start, but then Clinton takes it over and leads the audience till the very end. Verso is planning to make a searchable archive of at least 100 channels, where you could see patterns or trends, so you can have a full overview on any topic. Of course, it could be used to track any kind of object or product in any video. \\u201cFaces are just the beginning, we will add text and voice recognition, and of course understanding \\u2013 so any video will be marked as positive/negative,\\u201d says Gordeev. Verso has $100K in funding so far but plans to raise more money.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/board-of-hampton-creek-said-to-be-investigating-buyback-allegations/',\n",
       "  u'The board of Hampton Creek has hired one of the Big Four accounting firms to investigate claims in a Bloomberg story that the San Francisco-based vegan food company executed on a campaign to buy back mass quantities of its eggless mayo product, Just Mayo. A source familiar\\xa0with\\xa0the situation says the board was unaware of the alleged\\xa0scheme until contacted by Bloomberg\\u2019s reporters this fall, and that if CEO Josh Tetrick and other managers were \\u201cbuying back mayo solely for the purpose of juicing the numbers,\\u201d the board will be \\u201clivid.\\u201d This source says the board has no evidence of wrongdoing\\xa0currently but that an auditing firm is currently \\u201clooking at every f_cking receipt that the company has created.\\u201d A spokesman for the board refused comment. Tetrick also declined to comment for this story, though a source close to Tetrick insists that there is no board-initiated investigation ongoing or taking place imminently. In August, Bloomberg reported\\xa0that\\xa0the SEC\\xa0and the Justice Department had launched probes of Hampton Creek for possible securities violations and criminal fraud,\\xa0following\\xa0its report that Hampton Creek had hired contractors to purchase\\xa0Just Mayo from grocer\\u2019s shelves. Reporter Olivia Zaleski said in the piece that Bloomberg was \\u201cshown 250 receipts, expense reports, cash advances and e-mails\\u201d from these contractors\\xa0that collectively showed buybacks at Safeway,\\xa0Kroger, Costco, Walmart, Target, and Whole Foods. Tetrick told Bloomberg\\xa0that the buybacks were centered around quality control, but these same contractors said they were free to consume, distribute to friends, or discard the product rather than look for quality issues. What happens next is anyone\\u2019s guess, but a follow-on story in Bloomberg didn\\u2019t reflect well on Hampton Creek\\u2019s board, which was reportedly\\xa0warned by the successful entrepreneur and investor Ali Partovi that the company might have a truthiness issue, to steal from comic Stephen Colbert. As has been widely reported, Partovi, an early investor in the company, joined the company roughly two years ago as its chief strategy officer, but left after just nine days on the job. Though Tetrick initially characterized the split as amicable, calling Partovi an \\u201c incredible person ,\\u201d who has\\xa0\\u201cmade us better in numerous ways,\\u201d Partovi left out of concern that Hampton Creek was\\xa0misleading investors and board members and risking potential fraud lawsuits, says Bloomberg. The outlet says he talked with Tetrick directly about his concerns. He also warned the company\\u2019s\\xa0outside board members\\xa0from\\xa0Khosla Ventures and Horizons Ventures that Tetrick was misrepresenting the company\\u2019s finances. It also reported that after reviewing documents provided by the company and speaking with both Partovi and Tetrick, those board members\\xa0concluded that \\xa0\\u201cno further action was warranted.\\u201d \\xa0In fact, the firms went on to co-lead the company\\u2019s next funding, a $90 million C round. Partovi declined to comment for this story, but our source close to the situation confirms Bloomberg\\u2019s report. This person also notes, as did Bloomberg\\u2019s story, that Partovi was given the chance to sell his stake back to Hampton Creek and opted not to do so. (He later sold his shares to Saleforce CEO Marc Benioff.) Asked if the board reviewed the company\\u2019s\\xa0buyback offer, our source didn\\u2019t know. This person also adds that\\xa0fraud\\xa0wasn\\u2019t\\xa0part of that early conversation with Partovi, that Partovi\\u2019s concern, rather, was over aggressive revenue forecasts and that, pushed on whether Hampton Creek could grow into those numbers, Partovi\\xa0said they were not unachievable based on the pipeline of products that the company intended to bring to market. The\\xa0current investigation into Hampton Creek is the second launched by the board, our source says. It\\xa0also initiated an investigation into the startup in August of last year, after the Food and Drug Administration\\xa0sent Hampton Creek\\xa0a warning letter,\\xa0saying that\\xa0Just Mayo products were\\xa0\\u201cmisbranded\\u201d because they didn\\u2019t\\xa0meet the definition and standard of identity for mayonnaise. The issue was resolved after Hampton Creek agreed to make labeling changes.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/joymode-launch/',\n",
       "  u'Joymode is a startup for people who want to do fun things like host a backyard movie night or go on a camping trip \\u2014 but don\\u2019t necessarily want to buy\\xa0all the requisite equipment, especially if they\\u2019re only going to use it once. The company was founded by Joe Fernandez, Waynn Lue and Keith Walker. Fernandez previously founded social influence startup Klout and sold it to Lithium Technologies . \\u201cWhat we do is give people access to all the products they need but don\\u2019t\\xa0want to own for great experiences,\\u201d Fernandez told me. \\u201cThat could be anything \\u2014 tents for camping, cotton candy machines, a waffle press for brunch.\\u201d Fernandez recalled living in a small New York City apartment with his then-girlfriend (now his wife): \\u201cEvery time we bought something, we had to get rid of something else.\\u201d (As a New York resident myself, I can definitely relate.)\\xa0Since then, he\\u2019s continued to embrace \\u201ca relatively minimalist approach\\u201d to ownership, and he said many people are thinking similarly: \\u201cThere\\u2019s this\\xa0mega trend of people\\xa0really valuing experiences over ownership.\\u201d It\\u2019s that focus on experiences that\\u2019s supposed to make Joymode stand out. After all, equipment rental isn\\u2019t a new idea, but Joymode doesn\\u2019t rent you individual pieces of equipment. Instead, it creates kits designed to provide everything you need for\\xa0certain experiences and events \\u2014 Backyard Movie Night, Let\\u2019s Go Camping, Get Your Grill On and so on. Rather than focusing on a specific area \\u2014 say, outdoor recreation \\u2014 Fernandez said Joymode team members looked at their own lives and at the things they were borrowing throughout the year, using that as a starting point to decide what kinds of things to rent out.\\xa0He also noted that the company offers more utilitarian rentals too, like cleaning supplies or an overnight kit of sheets and towels when someone\\u2019s visiting. In addition to the equipment, Joymode tries to provide inspiration and support. \\xa0Curators are asked to share tips on things\\xa0like popular camping spots or recipes. Customers can also use the Joymode\\xa0mobile app to view GIF and video\\xa0instructions on how to use each item in the kit and, if they\\u2019re still stumped, get real-time chat support. Membership costs $99 per year, or you can buy a one-time guest pass. Joymode owns all the equipment itself, so it\\u2019s not a peer-to-peer sharing model. The company handles delivery and pickup, so (assuming what you want is in-stock) it can bring the equipment to your door as soon as you need it \\u2014 though Fernandez said the average reservation is about eight days ahead of time. \\u201cWe\\u2019re excited to expand to but at the same time, we\\u2019re learning some lessons from the last few years in the broader local space, with companies expanding too fast and collapsing in on themselves,\\u201d he\\xa0added. \\u201cWe are comfortable taking the time it\\u2019s going to take and so are our investors. We\\u2019re\\xa0eager to get to more cities, but not going to expand to just expand.\\u201d Speaking of investors, Joymode has raised $3 million in funding led by\\xa0Homebrew. Other backers\\xa0include Lowercase Capital, Founders Collective, Collaborative Fund, TenOneTen Ventures, Slow Ventures, Sherpa Ventures, Scott Belsky and Emil Michael.',\n",

       "  u'AT&T is in the advanced stages of negotiations to acquire Time Warner, according to the Wall Street Journal , which would give the carrier a huge content creation arm. Other carriers, including TechCrunch parent company Verizon, have embraced a similar strategy in order to own more of the relationship between customer and content, rather than just the delivery mechanism of the network. The WSJ\\u2019s report says that the deal could go down as soon as this weekend, but that it also isn\\u2019t final and could still collapse or be put off until later. Time Warner\\u2019s portfolio includes TNT, CNN, TBS and HBO, and would definitely give AT&T ownership of some of the premium content that drives demand for its satellite TV and broadband services. AT&T\\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner may seem unusual by U.S. industry standards, but in other countries it\\u2019s common for carriers and TV service providers to also own the content that they\\u2019re delivering to customers. In Canada, for instance, Rogers and Bell own sports teams, broadcast networks, licensing agreements for U.S.-based services like HBO and more. Consolidation likely isn\\u2019t going to be in the best interest of consumers, of course, since it gives the same companies that own the virtual network pipes more control over what goes through them, to whom, and for how much. On the carrier side, however, there\\u2019s a desire to diversify offerings in order to avoid becoming a dumb delivery mechanism for more lucrative services, and owning only a product that others including Google or Facebook may eventually provide for free. Plus, access to internet is increasingly being seen as a basic right, which means regulation could dampen provide margins related to network access down the road.',\n",

       "  u'Facebook wants you to know Live broadcasting isn\\u2019t just for celebrities. Facebook has bought a new series of US and UK TV, web, billboard, bus, and baggage claim ads that suggest you go Live when you see something cool, want to show off a talent, or just have something important to say. The campaign could further accelerate the growth of Live, which has seen the number of people broadcasting at any given minute go up 4X since May. Streams have come from all seven continents plus outer space, they cause people to comment 10X more than normal videos, get watched 3X longer than non-Live content, and most broadcasts come from regular people even if public figures get the biggest audiences. Facebook is competing with YouTube Live and Twitter\\u2019s Periscope for broadcasters and viewers, and the ads could help give it a populist edge. Here we\\u2019ve compiled all of the video ads into one clip: Facebook\\u2019s come a long way from its clumsy, confusing, and pretentious first TV spot celebrating its billionth user back in 2012 that declared \\u201cFacebook is like a chair\\u201d. Ya know, because it\\u2019s present in everyone\\u2019s life. The new campaigns are much more direct, comprehensible, and authentic. Each offers an example of what you could broadcast. In fact, Facebook\\u2019s CMO Gary Briggs writes \\u201cAll of the content for the campaign\\u2014every video, every image\\u2014was shot using Facebook Live on a phone.\\u201d Facebook typically lets failing products die rather than pour resources into them, suggesting it sees strong potential for Live. Here are all of the tag lines from the new ads, and where they\\u2019re running: Facebook was already spending to promote Facebook Live, but by planning to pay more than 140 news publishers and influencers a total of over $50 million to use Live . That seems to have successfully seeded the concept of Live streaming on Facebook, but now it has to get people to actually do it. While YouTube has positioned itself as a feature for web celebrities, and Periscope has focused on citizen journalism and expert Q&As, the Facebook Live ads position it as the broadcasting tool of the common man.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/researchers-sabotage-3d-printer-files-to-destroy-a-drone/',\n",
       "  u'Researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), the University of South Alabama, and Singapore University of Technology and Design have successfully injected malicious code into a computer which, in turn, added invisible commands to a file containing a 3D model of a drone propeller. When they printed the model and attached it to the drone, the propeller broke upon take-off. This killed the drone. In short, the exploit, codenamed Dr0wned, was able to modify a digital file that, in turn, destroyed a physical device. \\u201cImagine that an adversary can sabotage functional parts employed in an airplane\\u2019s jet engines. Such an attack could cost lives, cause economic loss, disrupt industry, and threaten a country\\u2019s national security,\\u201d said researcher Yuval Elovici, a professor at BGU. \\u201cWith the growth of additive manufacturing worldwide, we believe the ability to conduct malicious sabotage of these systems will attract the attention of many adversaries, ranging from criminal gangs to state actors, who will aim either for profit or for geopolitical power.\\u201d The attack works by hiding instructions inside a model file like an STL. These instructions make the printer appear to print a normal, solid part, but with a fatal flaw. When you use the piece in a working machine it quickly fails, destroying the part and the machine. The researchers injected malicious code into a plastic propeller and quickly destroyed a $1,000 drone in their tests. The exploit requires control over the victim\\u2019s computer. It begins with a phishing email that encourages the user to read a PDF which is actually a piece of remote access malware. The attacker then looks for all STL files and injects code in them that weakens the parts. The resulting defects are impossible to detect. For example, the propellers above are based on the same file but the one labelled A has been modified to fail. It is almost impossible to tell them apart. While not many people are printing mission critical objects on their home 3D printers we could imagine a future in which airplane parts are transmitted to a third party for heavy-duty printing. An exploit in that chain could prove more than fatal. Luckily this is still a proof of concept and the only thing hurt is an innocent but expensive drone.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/vr-and-inclusivity/',\n",
       "  u' For Brits of our generation, the first understanding of virtual reality might have been the VR glasses used by Lister in the TV series Red Dwarf to have \\u201csex.\\u201d Those a little older might remember the 1960s invention the Sensorama machine, which played stereoscopic 3D films accompanied by sound, wind, aromas and chair-tilting. Approaching 2017, Apple is rumored to be exploring VR, Google is expected to launch a new standalone VR headset to succeed Google Cardboard and PlayStation recently launched its VR headset. According to a report from Digi-Capital, investment in augmented reality and VR reached $1.1 billion in the first two months of this year. A billion-dollar industry is taking off, and we are excited that it has the potential to transform the lives of disabled people. But whatever the promise of this amazing tech, the industry has to move quickly to understand the needs and abilities of a full range of people and make sure it can offer a great experience for every possible user. For the 285 million people in the world who are blind or have sight loss, there\\u2019s a lot to consider in a virtual reality that relies heavily on eyesight. We would, of course, hope to see screen readers and voice tools like Siri incorporated into VR products as the standard. It\\u2019s also increasingly common to see screen interfaces that allow users to adjust the text size and contrast for different vision abilities, and we\\u2019d like to see this translated to VR. It might prove a little more tricky, but attention to detail is vital if VR is going to be something that everyone can use. We\\u2019re excited at the prospect of this technology helping people with certain eye conditions see things again \\u2014 by defining objects with greater contrast and clarity. Or if someone is blind and visual information can be represented in other ways, then this is a powerful method to allow the person to be aware of their surroundings and make informed decisions on navigation and interaction. There have been some big breakthroughs. For example, Bonny, the woman in the video below, was diagnosed with Stargardt\\u2019s disease 10 years ago and hadn\\u2019t been able to see any faces for eight years. The disease causes a reduction in your central, or detailed, vision. The video shows her using an Android app called Near Sighted VR Augmented Aid ,\\xa0which works with a phone camera and displays the front image to the phone screen in stereoscopic. Although sight loss might be the biggest inclusivity issue for developers to think about, it isn\\u2019t the only one. For the 360 million people in the world with hearing loss, VR developers should be looking to sync up/provide real-time captions without delays, as well as offer alternatives to sound effects, such as vibration/haptic feedback \\u2014 both of which would be beneficial for all users. The integration of recently invented SignAloud gloves would also be useful in VR to enable people who use sign language to communicate within the experience. While a lot of the focus of VR is sensory, there are a number of considerations for those with physical disability rather than a sensory loss. Users in a wheelchair, for example, might enjoy VR as a way to \\u201cmove\\u201d more easily around places their wheelchair can\\u2019t go, enabling them to climb mountains, or skateboard perhaps. However, for those parts of a VR experience that do require a physical movement and which aren\\u2019t possible for some people, developers need to find ways through. We would suggest this include such measures as enabling a user to send signals or \\u201cmove\\u201d using an eye tracker. We love the fact that VR is already being used in some cases to help aid muscle memory recovery for things like stroke, too. Synthesized environments help people simulate walking and other movements. The video\\xa0below shows a prototype of the Teslasuit \\u2014 a wireless outfit that\\xa0uses electro muscular stimulation and combines it with VR to make a more engaging experience. But inclusivity can be a lot more than basic accessibility. We think VR is a ripe opportunity to think outside conventions and make a world that is more user-friendly for all. At the moment, for example with the HTC Vive virtual reality headset, the head height (and controller location) of the user is automatically tracked, placing the camera level of the user at something closely approximating their natural head height, whether in a wheelchair or otherwise. What if there was a way to adjust the head height so that people in wheelchairs could choose to have a higher point of vision than they do in everyday life, enabling them to see and reach more clearly within the VR world, and have more access to their VR surroundings? It\\u2019s an exciting new world that is still in its infancy \\u2014 very few of the big players are even mentioning inclusivity. But like any area of digital accessibility, there is a huge opportunity in getting this right, and we\\u2019re confident that the next few years will see serious investment from companies looking to capitalize on the inclusive potential and really use this technology for social good.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/uncensoredbook/',\n",
       "  u'Facebook will soon display more graphic content including violence and nudity that would normally violate its policies as long as the imagery is newsworthy or important enough. Joel Kaplan, Facebook\\u2019s VP of global policy writes \\u201cOur intent is to allow more images and stories without posing safety risks or showing graphic images to minors and others who do not want to see them.\\u201d The move comes after criticism of Facebook\\u2019s temporary censorship of the famous \\u201cNapalm Girl\\u201d photo of a nude child from the Vietnam War, which was shared by a Norwegian journalist and later by the newspaper he works for. Eventually the company retreated and restored shares of the photo after heavy media and public backlash. Facebook also temporarily took down the video showing the final moments of Philando Castile before he died after\\xa0being shot by police. Facebook at the time claimed a \\u201ctechnical glitch\\u201d caused the disappearance of the newsworthy video. But Facebook\\u2019s VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri last month admitted that Facebook tries to \\u201cautomatically detect content that violates our standards. And we actually had a\\xa0sort of miscategorization.\\u201d That implies it was a wrongly applied censorship algorithm rather than some sort of mundane server outage. And just last night, Facebook censored a Swedish breast cancer awareness video , and has since apologized and restored it. While in July Facebook detailed its censorship policy to TechCrunch, clearly it needs a better-defined process for how to apply it, which apparently is what\\u2019s coming.  Recently\\xa0Facebook took feedback from its community about what they did and didn\\u2019t want to see. Its decision is that \\u201cIn the weeks ahead, we\\u2019re going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest \\u2014 even if they might otherwise violate our standards,\\u201d Kaplan\\xa0said. One possible way to do this would be to age-gate content that might be offensive to minors. As for adults, TechCrunch has suggested Facebook employ interstitial warnings about graphic content that users would have to click through to watch. To aid this, we\\u2019ve suggested that Facebook ad a content flagging option that something is \\u201cgraphic but newsworthy\\u201d, which would allow users to notify the company about content that needs a warning but shouldn\\u2019t be removed. Facebook has repeatedly stated that it\\u2019s not a media company, meaning it doesn\\u2019t have the same editorial responsibilities to avoid censorship even if it offends viewers. Facebook insists it operates as a technology platform that gives users what they want. On stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, Mosseri said that\\xa0\\u201cWe think of ourselves as a technology company. We know we play a meaningful role in media,\\u201d yet \\u201cour responsibility is to make sure we\\u2019re a platform for all ideas. We\\u2019re not in the business of deciding which ideas people should read about.\\u201d But by relaxing its community standards today, Facebook is directly contradicting that statement. It\\u2019s making a judgement call about what\\u2019s newsworthy and what people should read about, even if it might offend them or other users. This makes it clear that unless Facebook wants to run an unrestrained free-for-all of a content site or apply an inflexible censorship policy, it must accept its responsibilities as a media company.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/scientists-made-babies-from-mouse-skin-cells/',\n",
       "  u'A group of Japanese scientists from\\xa0Kyushu University has successfully turned mouse skin cells into baby mice without the use of egg cells. The technology skips over the usual method of fertilizing egg cells with sperm and instead uses a method to grow the cells with\\xa0the necessary chromosomal pairs\\xa0needed for life to begin. This is the first time something like this has ever been achieved and not a lot of the mouse cells from the lab led to live births, according to the study first reported in Nature . The study\\xa0builds on the work of Shinya Yamanaka , who won a Nobel prize in 2007 for his work in stem cell research. Yamanaka showed he could program adult skin cells to make pluripotent stem cells, which could be used to make any other types of cells for use in the body \\u2014 a crucial discovery in that it meant it was not necessary to destroy human embryos to grow stem cells to help with diseases like Parkinsons. The next part of the process was to produce mature sex cells from these pluripotent stem cells \\u2014 something the lead scientist in the study Katsuhiko Hayashi had tried to do back in 2012 while at the University of Kyoto. But that proved to be a lot harder. Until now, the scientists have only been able to produce something resembling egg and sperm cells and that didn\\u2019t work for making babies. The scientists in this study found they could make mature egg cells from mouse skin if they encased it in\\xa0cells taken from a part of a mouse fetus where it develops ovaries or testis. While that part of the operation helped to shape the stem cells into something more like an ovary, it could prove problematic down the line for those who might oppose using the cells of human embryos in the process of making humans from skin cells. However, Hayashi says he\\u2019s now working on some sort of artificial reagent to replace the fetal cells. But we likely won\\u2019t be getting any humans this way anytime soon if regulators have anything to do with it \\u2013 Hayashi and his team are not allowed to even make an attempt as Japanese law forbids fertilizing engineered human cells, even for research. And gene-editing on humans is even a thorny subject in the U.S. Where gene modification was once the wild west and some techniques supposedly produced now fully adult humans \\u2014 though it\\u2019s not clear what happened to them \\u2014 Federal regulators do not currently allow genetic modification of embryos. While that\\u2019s different from actually growing embryos from your own skin cells, it dips into unfamiliar territory and will surely be up for fierce debate \\u2014 particularly if it requires the use of embryonic cells to get us there. But the process still has a long way to go. Just 3.5 percent of the cells in the Japanese study produced live births. Compare that to other fertility methods like in vitro fertilization (IVF), which has a roughly 30 percent success rate or in vitro maturation (IVM), which is successful about 40 percent\\xa0of the time. Still, the idea that we are on the brink of creating humans from skin is mind-boggling and though the scientists working on this technology in Japan can\\u2019t continue with human cells, someone is bound to pick it up and\\xa0figure out how to do it, eventually.',\n",

A major cyberattack against an internet directory caused an outage for many popular sites like Twitter, Shopify, Spotify, Reddit, Vox Media, Airbnb and the New York Times.\\xa0The outages are the result of a DDoS\\xa0attack on the DNS\\xa0provider Dyn. 4. We reviewed the Google Pixel XL , concluding that the $796 device feels like a bridge to the future of the company. 5. Chinese tech\\xa0company LeEco burst into the North American market at a large event . The company introduced a line of TVs, two phones and a VR headset , along with a slew of other consumer electronics and a Netflix-type streaming service. Go big or go home, right? 6. Nintendo announced its next home gaming system, the Nintendo Switch .\\xa0As rumored, the system appears to be something of a home console/portable console hybrid. Here\\u2019s everything we know about the crazy new console .\\xa0We also got to go hands-on with the NES Classic Edition , which ships just in time for the holidays on November 11. 7. With Theranos, the SEC is finally getting the case its been waiting for . The company swiftly fell from grace after lawsuits and criminal investigations.\\xa0It\\u2019s an\\xa0ideal scenario for the SEC, which is investigating Theranos and widely expected to use a case against it to expand its mandate into Silicon Valley\\u2019s startup ecosystem. 8. Facebook is embracing utility with a slew of new features that launched this week . From Facebook Pages, you\\u2019ll now be able to order food, request an appointment with a business, or buy movie and event tickets without ever leaving Facebook. 9. Former Braintree founder Bryan Johnson invested $100 million of his own money into Kernel , a\\xa0new project with the sole purpose of building hardware and software to augment human intelligence.\\xa0Kernel is still very much in the planning stages, but the idea is to\\xa0facilitate communication between brain cells by\\xa0hacking the \\u201cneural code\\u201d that enables our brain to store and recall key information. 10. High profile investor Peter Thiel is said to be donating $1.25 million to Donald Trump\\u2019s campaign , despite recent controversies. Thiel is also slated to speak on\\xa0his support for\\xa0the GOP candidate . One question remains: why do we care? 11. Jobs and recruiting marketplace Glassdoor released a new tool to\\xa0help people better determine their worth in salary compensation. Know Your Worth aims to help people gain insight into how much money they make in comparison to other people working with similar jobs. 12. A telehealth startup called Opternative filed suit against South Carolina over a law that bars people from getting a glasses prescription with an online eye exam. An attorney on the case said that the law is particularly troubling because it appears to be driven by a wish to protect business interests rather than public health and safety.',\n",

       "  u'A new iMessage app from the music-focused social network SoundShare will now let you share entire tracks with your friends over text messaging. Of course, there\\xa0are already a number of ways to text friends your favorite music, thanks to the launch of the iMessage App Store. Apple Music has a built-in iMessage app, for example, and Pandora also rolled out one of its own earlier this month . However, these apps are limited because they work best\\xa0for those who are already using the given service, or have the appropriate app installed. Pandora\\u2019s iMessage app will kick non-users over the App Store to download it, if the recipient doesn\\u2019t have its app installed on their device. Plus, because it\\u2019s a music radio service, when your friend taps the track you\\u2019ve sent, it only plays a 30-second sample. And if you want to interact with the track further, you tap it to start\\xa0a Pandora artist station. This isn\\u2019t exactly the ideal way to share a song you want your friend to listen to it in\\xa0its entirety. SoundShare\\u2019s app works around the problem of people using different music services by giving your friend the option as to where they want to hear the song. By default, the recipient can choose to launch the song\\u2019s video on YouTube; stream it through Apple Music, if they\\u2019re a subscriber; or launch iTunes to hear the preview, and optionally purchase it or the album. Unfortunately, though SoundShare itself works with Spotify (Premium) and Deezer, these are not options in the iMessage app \\u2013 you can only launch the track to stream in full on SoundShare, if you\\u2019ve previously connected Spotify or Deezer\\xa0to your SoundShare account. The new iMessage app arrived in a recent update to SoundShare\\u2019s flagship iOS app, which debuted earlier this year. The main application offers a music social network of sorts, where you can find and follow others, create collaborative playlists, or view your friends\\u2019 playlists \\u2013 no matter which music service they\\u2019ve chosen to use. But the iMessage app is what makes SoundShare\\xa0worth the install, really. It\\u2019s a better experience than just texting a\\xa0YouTube link, which is what many people do today when sharing music over text messaging. Once installed, you can access SoundShare from the apps screen in iMessage. The interface offers a list of the Top 100 songs on its social network, which is useful if you want to see what\\u2019s trending and popular. However,\\xa0it doesn\\u2019t have separate sections for songs by genre or new releases. Instead, you just type in what you\\u2019re looking for using the search bar, then tap the song\\xa0to send it to your friend. The result is a much improved\\xa0experience for the recipient versus getting\\xa0a YouTube link, as SoundShare displays an image thumbnail alongside\\xa0a link that will offer all the streaming options. SoundShare\\u2019s new iMessage app is a free download from the iTunes App Store , and works on iOS 10 and higher.',\n",

For example, here are some of the questions you can now ask Alexa: The skill, which is a spin-off from the Share the Facts project , works by using natural speech recognition to analyze and answer questions from a database of around 2,000 professionally curated fact checks. Results are scaled so they\\u2019re both timely, and have the most consensus among the launch partners\\u2019 fact checking services. This isn\\u2019t the only way Amazon\\u2019s Alexa has been helping users during the presidential campaigns. Amazon itself recently rolled out new functionality that allows you to ask debate and other election questions directly, without the need for an additional skill. For example, Alexa was able to tell voters when the debates were airing on TV, can answer questions about who\\u2019s leading the polls, and will be able to answer questions about what states a given candidate has won. The latter question is one of several voice\\xa0commands Alexa will\\xa0answer starting on Election Day, as\\xa0the service will provide\\xa0real-time updates on the election. You\\u2019ll also be able to ask things like who\\u2019s winning, what percent of the popular vote a candidate has, who\\u2019s winning overall, who\\u2019s projected to win a particular state, how many votes were collected in that state, the election results by district, or even just: \\u201cwhat are the election results?\\u201d Already, users have been turning to Alexa for answers about the ongoing campaigns and debates. Amazon says\\xa0that Alexa saw a 4,000 percent increase in inquires related to the word \\u201chombre,\\u201d during the final debate on Wednesday, as one example. And the two most popular debate questions that users\\xa0asked\\xa0were, in order of popularity: \\u201cAlexa, what time is the debate?\\u201d and \\u201cAlexa, who won the debate?\\u201d Amazon also says that Alexa users have asked millions of questions to date related to the 2016 election. Hundreds of thousands of those questions were related to the debates. And people asked twice as many questions about Donald Trump compared with Hillary Clinton, Amazon notes. For what it\\u2019s worth, Alexa isn\\u2019t picking sides herself. She doesn\\u2019t claim either candidate won the last debate, for example, responding\\xa0that it\\u2019s not likely that either candidate lost or gained new votes. Meanwhile, when asked who she\\u2019s voting for \\u2013 something users have now asked over 13,000 times \\u2013 Alexa will only chirp: \\u201cThere are no voting booths in the clouds \\u2013 believe me, I\\u2019ve looked. It\\u2019s all ones and zeroes up here.\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'Do you make the hardest of things, hardware? We want you to compete in our Hardware Alley, our premier startup competition at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. You will have the chance to show your amazing products to representatives from major retailers, VCs, and other notables and you\\u2019ll climb far above the usual CES noise. Hardware Battlefield is part of TechCrunch\\u2019s Startup Battlefield series, but with a few small differences. We require that participating companies must have a hardware component to their product. That means everything from IoT devices to 3D printing, health wearables to drones are accepted. And, of course, robots. Hardware Battlefield takes places at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada. Battlefield contestants still have six minutes to pitch to our judging panel followed by six minutes of live Q/A. Judges include hardware investors like Rob Coneybeer, Highway1 and HAX, top designers like Yves Behar and product experts like Susan Paley of GM. Martha Stewart and 50 Cent have also been known to stop by. You can apply for the Battlefield here . The rules are simple: you need a functional prototype to show off at the show and you could win our coveted Metal Man prize and $50,000. It\\u2019s a great opportunity for a young and scrappy hardware company. So apply today and we hope to see you on the ground in Vegas where (hardware) dreams really do come true.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/this-smart-sock-adds-sensations-to-prosthetic-limbs/',\n",
       "  u'The future of prosthetics is fast arriving, with 3D-printed construction, advanced materials and embedded sensors replacing the unadorned wood and plastic of yore. But like the rest of the future, it\\u2019s not equally distributed. In order to bridge the gap for users who can\\u2019t afford or get at these fancy new prostheses, Austrian researchers propose smartening up dumb prosthetics with sensor-packed garments. The proCover, from the University of Applied Sciences in Linz, was presented at the Association for Computing Machinery\\u2019s UIST conference, where it was selected as one of the best papers. \\u201cThe design and construction of prostheses that can emulate a natural sense of touch is of growing research interest,\\u201d reads the paper\\u2019s introduction. \\u201cHowever, many of the exciting innovations in this field will likely remain out of reach for most people\\u2026 Our vision is to introduce a low-cost sensing wearable that can be applied retroactively to prosthetics to address this gap.\\u201d Their solution lies in the fact that many users of prostheses put socks on them just like any ordinary foot. Why not make this sock out of smart fabric? So that\\u2019s just what they did. Layers of conductive fabric sandwich a piezoresistive layer, creating a pressure-sensitive grid covering the entire foot and ankle. This was in turn connected to a ring of vibrating motors that can be worn wherever the user finds convenient. Pressure on a certain part of the foot would cause certain motors to vibrate at different frequencies. The researchers also tested a version that transmitted the angle at which a prosthetic knee is bent. It\\u2019s a flexible (in many ways) and low-cost way to sense the pressure and position, and the non-invasive feedback mechanism means no surgery is necessary. Next for the team is reducing the complexity of the sock even further, and developing a glove version that can be worn on prosthetic hands.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/lenovos-yoga-book-review/',\n",
       "  u'No mainstream electronics manufacture is making more interesting, innovative and downright bizarre products than Lenovo. Between its contorting efforts under the Yoga banner and the modular handsets being produced by Motorola, the Chinese company is taking the sort of form factor risks we rarely see outside of hardware startups. Nowhere is this better embodied than in the $499 Yoga Book . If nothing else, it\\u2019s impressive that the company has managed to produce yet another fascinating take on the well-trod world of the hybrid. This time out, the company leans heavily on the notion that handwriting is one of the great unsung casualties of the rise of the tablet. In fact, the system is built around the return of pad and paper, incorporating the analog-to-digital output of devices like kind offered by Wacom\\u2019s budget Bamboo line into a high-end, $500 device. When we spoke to the company ahead of its launch, they saw it as primarily as a play for college students \\u2013 a combination note taking device and standalone computer all in one. It\\u2019s a bit of a gamble, as these sorts of radical form factor departures always are. But if nothing else, it\\u2019s an utterly fascinating piece of hardware from an industry that too often defaults to more of the same. The Yoga Book is thin as hell. It\\u2019s 9.6 millimeters thin. That\\u2019s 0.38 inches, compared to the Macbook\\u2019s 0.52 and 1.5 pounds to the Apple laptop\\u2019s 2.03. It\\u2019s perhaps a somewhat unfair comparison, given the difference in screen sizes, but it does drive home how remarkably compact the device is. And indeed, it really does feel like a marvel of engineering \\u2013 it\\u2019s thin and light enough to slip into a backpack with little notice, while maintaining the sturdiness of a full laptop. The solidness of build quality is due in no small part to the hinge. It looks a bit gauche and out of place at first, like a metal watchband connecting the two panels. It\\u2019s perhaps not aesthetically consistent with the other understated pieces, but it manages to contort the system to nearly 360-degrees, never wobbling the whole time. Closed, the system takes on the appearance of a scaled down ThinkPad \\u2013 albeit one largely devoid of ports. All you get is a single micro-USB (not USB C, mind) for both charging and plugging in accessories and micro HDMI \\u2013 more inline with its tablet roots than laptop aspirations. Sandwiched between the two is a micro SD slot. On the other side are the device\\u2019s sole physical buttons: power and volume, along with, yes, a headphone jack. Inside the book are two completely flat panels. Up top is a fairly standard squared touchscreen display surrounded by a thick black bezel, with a two-megapixel camera up top and a silver \\u201cLenovo Yoga Book\\u201d logo in the bottom right corner. The bottom panel, however, is where things get really interesting. It\\u2019s also where Lenovo tries to be everything to everyone. Powered off, the bottom panel is entirely black, with the ghostly suggestion of a keyboard. Once on, the keys illuminate. It\\u2019s a nice effect \\u2013 the Halo keyboard. It looks good, and it certainly goes a way toward shedding a few fractions of an inch from\\xa0the Yoga Book\\u2019s profile. But the drawback is equally apparent. You\\u2019re typing on a flat surface, and all of the haptic feedback in the world won\\u2019t change that. Granted, I\\u2019ve only been using the Yoga Book for a limited period, but I really don\\u2019t think the experience is for me. A little give is important to the typing experience, and that much haptic buzzing is more of an annoyance. Again, Lenovo\\u2019s banking on younger users for this device \\u2013 including high school and college kids \\u2013 whose formative typing experiences largely occurred on touchscreen phones and tablets. The Android experience also has the added bonus of offering up predictive text as you type, akin to a mobile device, which some users may find to be a plus. Experience will also come down to precisely how much typing you plan to do on the thing. After all, that bottom black surface houses another key feature. Hold down on the little pen icon above the keyboard and you\\u2019ll fell a haptic buzz before the surface goes black. The included stylus is the size of a standard pen and features a variety of different tips, both standard plastic stylus and a ballpoint ink variety, so users can write directly on the surface or magnetically snap a pad of paper on top and write the old-fashioned way. Either way, the surface serves as a display surrogate, with text appearing on-screen in real time, as you write. Using the Note Saver app, you can switch between a trio of thickness options, ballpoint/fountain/pencil, and six colors. It\\u2019s fairly simple with an MS Paint-like interface, but it does the trick for note taking. Unfortunately absent from the app is OCR \\u2013 which converts handwriting to text. The Lenovo rep I spoke to said the company just didn\\u2019t believe the technology was accurate enough to employ this time around \\u2013 a pretty big downside for those of us with abysmal handwriting that\\u2019s only gotten worse as we\\u2019ve moved more and more to the keyboard. At the very least, it\\u2019s a less roundabout way to incorporate the sorts of analog to digital note taking capabilities from companies like Wacom and Livescribe directly into a device. For the moment, however, the demand for such functionality still feels about as slim as the device itself The unit we received runs Android (a fairly old 6.0.1 \\u2013 with Nougat arriving somewhere down the road). Another $50 will get you the Windows 10 version \\u2013 probably a worthy upgrade for anyone seriously looking to integrate the Lenovo Book into their daily computing life. If you opt for the Android version, be forewarned that it comes with all of the limitations of that platform. Both version of the device run on an Intel Atom processor, coupled with 4GB of RAM. It\\u2019s enough to get most day-to-day functions accomplished, but don\\u2019t look toward the device to do any heavy lifting. The Yoga Book is better suited for in-class/office devices, rather than a full-bodied laptop replacement. The battery, meanwhile, is a hefty 8500 mAh, which ought to get you through a full day\\u2019s use, no problem. The Yoga Book isn\\u2019t for everyone. But then, Lenovo\\u2019s approach has never been one-size-fits-all. It\\u2019s a well designed piece of hardware (though you\\u2019ll want to find a spot for your notepad and stylus, so there\\u2019s no room on the device itself), that seemed likely doomed for a fairly narrow user-base. Students and others who have long searched for a well-made tablet with integrated pen and paper note taking capabilities may just have found their dream device. For most of us, however, it\\u2019s a tablet oddity. It\\u2019s fascinating and a bold attempt to bring yet another take to the hybrid space, but as it stands, it\\u2019s not ready to set the tablet world ablaze.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/zwift-merges-indoor-fitness-with-massive-multi-player-online-gaming/',\n",
       "  u'At its core, Zwift is indoor cycling software. But layered on top of its functionality is a community that in the two years the company has been operating has grown in both scale and shear strength. At an event at Rapha\\u2019s cycling in SF, I found myself surrounded by core users proudly flaunting their team names and meeting, often not for the first time. Even Barry Bonds showed up to the happening little shop to check out what Zwift had going on. Without trying it for yourself, it can be difficult to wrap your brain around how the gaming, fitness and social aspects tie together. It\\u2019s a cycling community, built on gaming software, that connects to indoor training. Put simply, Zwift has built software that,\\xa0from the comfort of your own home or local gym, allows you to feel like you are riding alongside your friends on your favorite scenic road. Zwift has grown steadily this past year, with 170,000 accounts, 2.5 million rides and 45 million miles ridden to date. According to\\xa0the team, the average ride is longer than an hour, which is impressive. If you\\u2019ve ever spent time on a bike at home or the gym, you know that anything more than 20 minutes and you start to feel like a hamster (or at least I do). So why have so many people never heard of Zwift? The company isn\\u2019t new. With 17,000 Twitter followers , 100,000 fans on Facebook and a half million views on YouTube , Zwift has had little mainstream press coverage recently outside of the cycling circuit. A month or so ago, Mark Zuckerberg did post his support of Zwift when he found himself using\\xa0it\\xa0as a recovery option after breaking his arm. Turns out there are many other tech execs on the platform, including Max Levchin , Kevin Systrom and Uber\\u2019s Ed Baker . But the biggest barrier as to why the company isn\\u2019t more well-known in tech circles is that until you try it yourself, it\\u2019s hard to really grasp what\\u2019s so great about it or when and where you would use it. Zwift isn\\u2019t hardware or a device you can just buy. It\\u2019s a subscription-based service where you pay $10/month and BYOBike. Unlike Peloton, which requires you to buy a $2,000 bike to ride or take their classes, you can use any road bike on any indoor trainer regardless of its age or fanciness, simply by adding some sensors. Trying Zwift for yourself still requires some setup with fairly high-end sports equipment or belonging to a gym that has the above. Zwift is hard to come by, despite technically being an accessible platform to fitness enthusiasts. When you see it in action, though, you immediately want to saddle up and try it for yourself, regardless of what you are wearing, which in my case was jeans and heels. Digging into the software itself, Zwift does two things. First, it tracks your activity and performance stats. \\u201cThere\\u2019s actually real data behind all this. It\\u2019s not just a game. We measure everybody\\u2019s watts, their heart rate recorded, we have their cadence, the rate that they are peddling the bicycle. We log it all to a real data file, and industry standard fit file, and it also uploads to all the standard services like Strava,\\u201d says co-founder and lead developer Jon Mayfield . Second, it connects to compatible hardware to adjust the tension of the bike and mirror the ride experience of the course you see in front of you. \\u201cWhen you are going up or down slopes in Zwift, certain trainers, which is the thing the bike mounts to, have a smart feature where they can actually change resistance. So we support every smart trainer out there to control the feeling. So when you are going up a steep mountain, you are going to feel it. When you are going down a descent, if you do want to pedal it\\u2019s going to be very easy. We also use that controllable feature so that when you are doing a workout we can make it so you are putting out just the correct amount of effort so you get perfect structured training intervals every time.\\u201d True to the gamified nature of Zwift, you have a profile with your stats and an avatar you can customize, selecting not only your jersey, but also which brand and model of bike you ride. In 2017, the company expects to improve character customization to include mustaches, goatees, jewelry and more. Also slated to roll out in the coming months is voice interaction, which will help build on the social aspects by allowing you to talk to anyone on the platform. Zwift\\u2019s iOS app, currently in beta, is expected to go public, making the service mobile and much easier to use. With the introduction of this new app, all you\\u2019ll need is a heart-rate monitor to run or ride on Zwift. Then, there is, of course, running, which will be introduced in beta to current users as early as Christmas. At launch, running will be alongside existing cycling courses. But there is huge potential to build a dedicated experience for trail running, marathons and possibly even spin it out to become its own subscription service. To support these new endeavors, Zwift is closing a $25 million\\xa0round in early November. Though the company is unable to disclose exactly who is involved, the round is being led by a private equity firm based in London with other investments in the video game space. The funds will be used to further product development and to lay the foundation for future growth. Prior to this Series A round, Zwift has quietly raised starting with a friends and family round at launch and their first angel round earlier this year. Zwift\\u2019s biggest challenge to date has been waiting for hardware to catch up. VR, for example, is something the company has built and made available, but headsets are still bulky and aren\\u2019t designed for fitness in VR. Smart trainers, which are core to the company\\u2019s functionality, still average around $1,000, and there is a finite supply of popular modules. Zwift\\u2019s CEO, Eric Min , says to expect hardware partnerships in early 2017. \\u201cOur vision is to create the most engaged and socially active fitness platform.\\u201d The company is talking to manufacturers of stationary bikes and eventually treadmills that will be Zwift compatible, making the service more available and easier to use. \\u201cIf you work long hours, if you live somewhere with limited access to the outdoors, places where there are weather issues, you always have the opportunity to ride your bike with a fun group of people in Zwift,\\u201d says VP of Product and Olympic cyclist, Mike McCarthy . \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t take away outdoor riding. It just gives people the opportunity to ride more.\\u201d Personally, I am bullish on Zwift and hope to see them grow into the virtual fitness future that they have the potential to lead. Despite living in perfectly sunny and temperate San Francisco, I find indoor workouts more convenient. You can sweat at home or at your local gym, hit the shower and get back to your day. There is also the added safety element of not wanting to ride or run at night, especially as a woman. For urbanites like me, it also removes the risk of getting hit by a car, which happens far more than any of us know. The social aspect of Zwift is also intriguing. If I could catch up with my friend in Berlin, while we virtually ride next to one another on the same loop, I might work out more. With more than 500 community events a month, there are plenty of group rides you can join. But what I find most motivating is that, despite being stationary on a bike, you feel like you are going somewhere. Zwift\\u2019s integration with Strava shows the virtual path you completed, and seeing the map and incline stats for the path you rode gives you a sense of accomplishment that a calorie count or heart-rate stats just don\\u2019t. Take all these reasons and add running to the mix, and I think there is massive potential for Zwift to tip over into the world of mainstream fitness.',\n",

       "  u'Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff took the stage at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing today to talk about diversity and equality.\\xa0This comes just weeks after Salesforce brought on board Tony Prophet, its first-ever Chief Equality Officer . Equality, Benioff said, has to be something that Salesforce stands for, just like it stands for growth, innovation, new ideas and creating new technology. \\u201c[Equality] is a huge issue for the world,\\u201d Benioff said. \\u201cThis is not just about Salesforce or the tech industry or just industries. We are in a world that we can see inequality everywhere we go. We know a lot about income inequality. We know a lot about racial inequality. We know about inequality with women. We know about LGBTQ inequality.\\u201d He went on to say that inequality is a \\u201cmulti-faceted beast\\u201d and that it\\u2019s something we all need to become experts on. Not just leaders like himself, but everyone. \\u201cWe\\u2019re fighting this beast,\\u201d Benioff said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s out there.\\u201d In order to fight the beast of inequality, Benioff said, we need to better understand why we\\u2019re seeing more inequality in the world. We also need to recognize that the solution to inequality is equality, he\\xa0said. In response to a question about his involvement in demanding that North Carolina repeal its anti-LGBT law , Benioff talked about the importance of seeing ourselves in each other. Even though he identifies as a white, heterosexual man, he said he\\u2019s also a lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans. \\u201cI am all of our employees,\\u201d Benioff said. \\u201cI am the whole rainbow. I have to represent everybody. I also feel like I am the one who is being oppressed and repressed, but I am also the oppressor. I am trying to have a consciousness where I understand how my employees feel.\\u201d He later added, \\u201cI think that we all have to see ourselves in each other.

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/23/atts-new-streaming-service-directv-now-just-got-a-lot-more-interesting/',\n",
       "  u'AT&T\\u2019s soon-to-launch live streaming service, DirecTV Now, just got a lot more interesting following AT&T\\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner . Announced earlier this year , DirectTV Now was\\xa0already an anticipated new arrival on the cord-cutting scene, thanks to\\xa0its plans to stream more than 100 live channels over the Internet without having to agree to traditional pay TV contract. More of a rival to Dish\\u2019s Sling TV or Hulu\\u2019s forthcoming live TV offering, than something like Netflix, the acquisition will give\\xa0AT&T access to Time Warner\\u2019s formidable media properties for its video service at the best possible terms. That could translate into better packages and pricing\\xa0for DirecTV Now subscribers. That is, more of the quality pay TV channels could be offered under one low price point, instead of breaking up the available channels into \\u201cskinny bundles\\u201d \\u2013 something AT&T and DirecTV haven\\u2019t been keen on , saying that these\\xa0smaller packages aren\\u2019t scalable. Instead, when AT&T in March announced its plans to launch its own streaming service, DirecTV Now, it said the idea would be to offer all the content you\\u2019d typically find in a regular pay TV bundle, but un-tether it from the set-top box. The company had described it as \\u201cpay TV as an app.\\u201d With Time Warner\\u2019s content coming in-house, AT&T has gained access to wealth of TV and movie properties, including HBO, CNN, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, and the Warner Bros. film studio, home to the Harry Potter and DC Comics franchises. Through Turner, its has the rights to the NBA, March Madness and MLB. That will help with its channel lineup and selection. And with HBO under its wing, AT&T can take advantage of the technical learnings HBO has acquired by running its own, successful over-the-top streaming service, HBO NOW. As any Sling TV subscriber can tell you, there\\u2019s still plenty of room to compete in this area by offering a streaming TV service focused on cable-like programming, but with fewer glitches and a better user experience. Sling TV still has\\xa0an awful interface, despite its upgrades, and has struggled in the past under peak usage , as with the season premiere of \\u201cGame of Thrones,\\u201d for example. HBO, meanwhile, has seemed to better figure out how to handle massive loads of viewers. Then there\\u2019s the fact that, as a carrier, AT&T has will offer better deals to DirecTV subscribers who are also AT&T customers. The company already said that the data require to stream it on mobile, would be incorporated into the content cost. This could help AT&T better compete with T-Mobile, which has been marketing its \\u201cBinge On\\u201d services as a way to stream music and video from over 100 top services without counting towards your data plan. For AT&T, the deal, of course, means the carrier has a way to make money from mobile video, which is also what it\\u2019s betting on as the future of TV. More people today aren\\u2019t just cutting the cord, they\\u2019re forgoing a pay TV subscription altogether, opting for over-the-top subscription services like Netflix, or even just free video content like YouTube. That has put AT&T, like other mobile operators, into the position of being a \\u2018dumb pipe\\u2019 \\u2013 something all are loath to do. With a mobile-optimized streaming TV service, sold as an add-on to its cellular service, that changes. But while there are advantages to the deal from AT&T\\u2019s perspective, consolidation like this could be bad for competition. AT&T will own some of the best video content around, and could then deny it to rivals, raise the licensing costs or use it as a bargaining chip in rights negotiations. These concerns, however, are likely to be the focus of regulators , who could require certain concessions for deal approval \\u2013 like not withholding HBO from rival\\xa0streaming services, for example \\u2013 or not discriminating against competitors\\u2019 content on its service \\u2013 something Comcast had to agree to with\\xa0its own\\xa0NBCUniversal deal.

       "  u'How do you make things funny in virtual reality? That\\u2019s the question CollegeHumor is exploring with 1600 in 360\\xb0, a new video\\xa0series depicting some of the, um, highlights of U.S. presidential history. Apparently, Google\\xa0approached IAC-owned CollegeHumor about creating 360-degree content for YouTube and for its DayDream VR platform .\\xa0Sam Reich, president at CollegeHumor\\u2019s production\\xa0studio\\xa0Big Breakfast, told me Big Breakfast\\xa0considered\\xa0some of the constraints \\u2014 mainly\\xa0the fact that the camera should be stationary\\xa0to avoid giving viewers motion sickness. And because the series would be stuck in one room, they asked themselves, \\u201cWhat is a room where you would love to be a fly on the wall?\\u201d Their answer: The Oval Office. The series will feature six presidents, starting with today\\u2019s episode on John Adams . As you watch, you can spin the camera around and\\xa0look all over the room, which is full of gags and jokes. (Yes, there\\u2019s an obligatory Hamilton joke.) Asked about the challenges and opportunities of the new format, Reich said,\\xa0\\u201cI\\u2019m going to get really comedy nerdy here.\\xa0Comedy dating back to Buster Keaton has been about playing with the frame, sort of making use of your body in space. That\\u2019s what makes VR so intimidating \\u2026 There\\u2019s not the same amount of room to play around with framing.\\u201d Put another way: It\\u2019s harder to pull off a visual joke when you don\\u2019t know where the audience is going to be looking, so\\xa0the dialogue had to carry more weight, both plot- and humor-wise.\\xa0The script had to be much more detailed than usual, because it was both describing\\xa0the main events and\\xa0what\\u2019s happening\\xa0on the other side of the room. And because the video\\xa0is just one continuous shot, they couldn\\u2019t cut between different takes. \\u201cWe rehearsed for a full week, did five or six takes and then used the best take,\\u201d Reich said. The next episodes will tackle Lincoln,\\xa0both Roosevelts and Nixon \\u2014 plus an episode planned for Election Day, which Reich\\xa0said they\\u2019re keeping as a surprise. He added that he\\u2019s proud of the show\\u2019s \\u201cnon-traditional casting.\\u201d John Adams, for example is played by Siobhan Thompson \\u2014 not exactly the old white guy you\\u2019d expect. As for whether there\\u2019s more VR in CollegeHumor\\u2019s future, Reich said the company\\xa0is waiting to see the response to this first show, but he added, \\u201cWe have a big appetite for VR in general.\\u201d And hey, they\\xa0could even keep going with\\xa0U.S. history: \\u201cWe\\u2019re only tackling six presidents here. There\\u2019s clearly room for more.\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/the-reality-of-arvr-competition/',\n",
       "  u' Virtual, augmented and mixed reality have a competition problem. But while most AR/VR companies will tell you how much better they are than their nearest direct competitor, they\\u2019re picking the wrong fight. The main event isn\\u2019t between Oculus, HTC, Sony, Samsung and Google for VR, or Microsoft, Magic Leap, Meta and ODG for AR (including mixed reality). There are far bigger and scarier competitors out there. Status quo is AR/VR\\u2019s biggest competitor (and I don\\u2019t mean the band that opened Live Aid ). People spend almost 11 hours a day using electronic media. That means out of the average 79 years folks spend on the planet, more than 34 of them are devoted to media. What could be so fascinating that we give almost half of our lives to it? TV (live and time shifted) makes up 48 percent of media time, phone/tablet 20 percent, radio 18 percent, online PC 9 percent and everything else 6 percent. And while most media are flat to down, smartphones and tablets have done what was previously thought impossible: They grew the media market. Phone/tablet time has more than doubled to more than two hours a day in the last two years alone. And this skews even more strongly the younger you are. Old farts complaining about young people glued to their phones aren\\u2019t just being grumps \\u2014 they\\u2019re being right. So the biggest question is how does AR/VR compete with TVs, phones and tablets? And that\\u2019s not all. While folks choose to spend half their lives with electronic boxes, they spend even more time doing things they can\\u2019t avoid. Work and sleep each take up almost seven hours a day on average, which, when combined with media time adds up to the full 24 hours it takes the Earth to spin around once. There isn\\u2019t much AR/VR can do about sleep, as even mighty mobile hasn\\u2019t conquered that barrier. But what about work (and other aspects of life)? This is where the triumph of mobile has clear lessons for AR/VR, but also where VR and AR start to diverge. The keen-eyed will have spotted that the 24 hours of media, sleep and work don\\u2019t allow any time for eating, sport, chores, family, socializing, commuting and the other noble pursuits \\u2014 which clearly some of us like to do. This is where plurality comes in. It\\u2019s been a major driver of mobile\\u2019s success. Plurality (or second screening in relation to TV specifically) is where folks do more than one thing at the same time. Eighty-seven percent of people use their phone, tablet or (to a lesser extent) PC as a second screen while watching TV. Some would argue that TV has actually become the second screen, with people watching it while using their phones. But that\\u2019s not all for plurality and mobile. The average person checks their phone more than 40 times a day (more than 70 times per day if you\\u2019re younger). Folks eat, do chores, look after family, socialize, commute and more while using them. The smartphone is the first thing many people see as soon as they open their eyes in the morning (and other unmentionable morning things \\u2014 hence waterproof phones). The beauty of VR is its total immersion. That\\u2019s one of the reasons it will be big . But VR is all-consuming by nature, which gives it a plurality challenge that mobile did not face. Try walking down the street or interacting meaningfully with someone outside your headset while in VR. And while you can second-screen your TV or smartphone with VR streaming, you\\u2019re still doing it inside VR rather than in the world around you. So in terms of time, VR has to cannibalize one of the other demands on your allotted 24 hours a day. This is a hard competitive problem with mass consumers (so grandpa and your niece, not core gamers). VR will need to knock something else off its pedestal to grab a big chunk of their time without the benefit of plurality. It\\u2019s battling head-on with the status quo and everything else. AR has harder technical challenges to solve than VR, which is why it is currently focused on more forgiving enterprise users and not mass consumers yet. But the most aggressive AR roadmaps are launching for mass consumers in 2017 going into 2018 \\u2014 so it\\u2019s just a question of time. When consumer AR gets here, it will have the same competitive advantage mobile had: plurality. In fact, AR could have an even greater advantage than mobile did. No need to take it out of your pocket. No looking down to check it. No small screen to limit what you see. Nobody looking over your shoulder to see you playing Candy Crush at work. No bumping into things while you\\u2019re checking WeChat. And this isn\\u2019t just conjecture. Ever seen a couple of kids walking down the street playing Pok\\xe9mon Go together? Even with that sort of very basic AR, its plurality is already well proven. Industry competition is even more exciting, because, so far, nobody is dominant in any part of AR/VR. It\\u2019s just too early in the market\\u2019s development for anyone to dominate yet. So while there is a healthy level of competition, it\\u2019s all to play for and the rules are being written right now. One of the nice things about seeing this from inside the industry is that while folks will trash-talk each other, the community remains a collaborative one. There seems to be a good understanding that the better everyone does, the better everyone does (it\\u2019s why our quarterly VR/AR CEO forum Reality Check gets hundreds of competing CEOs, corporate divisional heads and VC partners doing deals and working together). So roll on AR/VR competition. It\\u2019s going to be a blast.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/six-reasons-to-be-hyped-for-the-nintendo-switch-and-four-reasons-to-worry/',\n",
       "  u'Yesterday saw the introduction \\u2014 after many leaks and rumors \\u2014 of the Nintendo Switch , the company\\u2019s next game console. It isn\\u2019t due to arrive until March of next year, which is infinitely frustrating because it looks amazing for several reasons, not all of them obvious. Here\\u2019s why I\\u2019m more excited about the Switch than for any Nintendo product in a long time. The Wii was a blast, and sold like hotcakes. But the Wii U was a strange and some would say lazy upgrade that attempted to squeeze more money out of the same ideas. In the end, their entire strategy was compromised and they lost both players and games. The Switch jettisons all that baggage, cutting things off clean except for useful accessories (more to come) like the Pro Controller. This fresh start means Nintendo can start a completely new dialog with gamers, developers and consumers, all of whom have been somewhat abandoned over the last few years. While Nintendo distanced itself from\\u2026 well, itself, it also managed to keep separate from the competition. It does things neither the PS4 nor Xbox One does, while those two systems are, in many ways, almost identical. What that means is that, while very few people are going to buy both Microsoft and Sony\\u2019s consoles, it\\u2019s totally possible people will want a Switch in addition to the \\u201ctraditional\\u201d console of their choice. Perhaps the failure to launch in time for the holidays was a strategic move: steer clear of the marketing push by the 900-pound gorillas and strike later, when people are looking for something new (and have recouped their holiday expenses with a few paychecks). With the Wii, people \\u201cgot\\u201d it when they put their hands on it. \\u201cOh, you actually move around!\\u201d With the Wii U, people\\u2026 didn\\u2019t get it. I still don\\u2019t get it, and I have one! \\u201cIt\\u2019s a second screen? But also the main screen, sometimes? But you have to be in Wi-Fi range, because it\\u2019s not the actual console? And sometimes you have to look at both screens?!\\u201d With the Switch, people will get it as soon as they see it. \\u201cOh, you can use it anywhere, and the controllers come off!\\u201d If people can imagine a way to use it, Nintendo probably already thought of it and put it in the reveal commercial. There are a few questions remaining, of course, but the basic idea explains itself. That\\u2019s a big plus. Here\\u2019s a picture of my coffee table. Hmm, there\\u2019s\\u2026 actually a lot going on there, but mainly I wanted to show that I love playing awesome Nintendo games on my couch so much that I\\u2019ve literally never put away the SNES I got as a kid. Couch co-op (or competition) is in Nintendo\\u2019s DNA, more so than perhaps any company in the world. It\\u2019s something Nintendo cares about deeply, and has always made a priority. The Wii and Wii U emphasized couch multiplayer, and the Switch does too, but so fundamentally that it\\u2019s literally built into the console itself, off the shelf. That\\u2019s a great sign. Nintendo may finally, finally be embracing mobile as a platform , but that raises the question of whether something like the 3DS is even necessary. The Switch is the answer to that question. You don\\u2019t use the Switch in the same places you use your phone. It\\u2019s not for wasting time while you wait for your sandwich to come up, it\\u2019s for when you might otherwise pull out a book, watch a show or listen to a podcast. It\\u2019s just as powerful as your home console, because it is your home console. And that also means that, unlike the Vita or even 3DS, you\\u2019re not getting ports or handheld-first games \\u2014 yet games that are better on handheld will be just as much at home. Count the number of kids shown in the reveal video . Go ahead, I\\u2019ll wait. Did you get zero? Good, that\\u2019s what I got. Nintendo knows that its real user base is an aging cohort of gamers attached to the franchises it holds. They don\\u2019t need to show a thing like with the Wii U, where Junior can play Mario while Dad watches the game. More likely is a situation where Dad\\u2019s playing Mario while Junior is playing Gears of War. Yet the simplicity and flexibility of the setup (and ease of replacing individual pieces, it bears mentioning) means they definitely were keeping kids, especially smaller ones, in mind when designing it. Bring it in the car so the kids can play Smash on a road trip. Easy cleanup, no cords, no wrist straps or arguing over who gets the Wiimote Plus. Now, I said I was hyped, but I didn\\u2019t say I don\\u2019t have any reservations. The announcement was a little short on details, in that special Nintendo way, which leaves me wondering\\u2026 No one touches the screen in the reveal video, and Nintendo has refused to comment. No touchscreen would be a big change for them, since the Switch is meant to encompass both home and handheld gaming, and the last million or so DS iterations had touchscreens. People expect screens they handle to be touchable, and Nintendo wants the device to be easy to relate to. My guess? It has a touchscreen but they\\u2019re not sure whether it\\u2019s going to be resistive or capacitive, and the stylus situation is similarly unanswered. Let\\u2019s hope, anyway. How else will we get Mario Maker Switch? This comes up pretty much any time Nintendo releases anything \\u2014 and with good reason. Are we going to get 60 frames per second? What resolutions will it drive? What are the modern conveniences developers will appreciate, or the bottlenecks they will curse? We\\u2019ll know more later \\u2014 my feeling is they are hammering out the nitty-gritty details and seeing what they can get to fit under a $300 price point (the logical price) by March or whenever they ship. Nintendo knows one of its strengths is its huge collection of games stretching back three decades. They\\u2019re not going to abandon that \\u2014 but they might have to abandon the last five years or so. The Switch is just too different from the Wii or Wii U to port over games, meaning great games from those consoles will stay there. Can we expect Switch-specific remakes of Super Mario 3D World, Pikmin 3, and others? The Switch will also be an amazing platform for playing your old NES and SNES games \\u2014 expect the interface from the NES Classic Mini to appear here \\u2014 but will we have to re-buy everything? Is it going to be a fuss? How much from our old accounts and Nintendo consoles will carry over? The Switch is a handheld, but will it be Nintendo\\u2019s only handheld? In some ways, it makes sense: unify everyone under the same strong brand, hardware and message. In other ways, it\\u2019s completely insane: Nintendo\\u2019s handhelds are among the best-selling systems of all time and they, too, are part of the company\\u2019s DNA. Does the Switch signal a change to the home/handheld divide that Nintendo has held for so long? Will its smartphone division pick up the pieces? What will mega-franchises like Pok\\xe9mon and Monster Hunter do? I can\\u2019t imagine Nintendo leaving the dedicated handheld market behind, but I also don\\u2019t know what they can do to keep it fresh and distinct from the Switch. Even with the uncertainty around some features and the future of the space Nintendo is defining, I think the Switch is a hugely positive move for the company. It focuses on fun and sharing that fun with friends, while avoiding questionable gimmicks like 3D and whatever you\\u2019d call the Wii U. Instead, it makes an advance others have yet to try, as did the original Wii and DS, both of which added something unique and intuitive to a games market that needed it. I can\\u2019t wait for it, and not just because of the new Zelda. And the new Mario. And the newish Splatoon. And,\\xa0God willing, a new Metroid. But because I want to see Nintendo a household name again, and I think the Switch may just be the platform that makes that happen.',\n",

       "  u'Another city, another Airbnb lawsuit. Airbnb sued the city of New York, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Mayor Bill de Blasio today over legislation that would make it illegal to advertise accommodations that can\\u2019t legally be rented out for less than 30 days. The bill was passed in June and signed into law by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo earlier today. New York housing law restricts short-term rentals for certain housing, and housing advocates in the city argue that many of the units listed on Airbnb are illegal. Although these hosts can already face steep fines, the new law would make it illegal for Airbnb to allow listings for these units on their platform. Airbnb claims the law is a violation of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for content posted by their users. In the suit, Airbnb says that application of the law to Airbnb \\u201cwould hold Airbnb liable for the content of rental listings\\xa0created and posted by third-parties on Airbnb\\u2019s platform. As such, the Act unquestionably treats platforms such as Airbnb as the publisher or speaker of third-party content and is completely preempted by the CDA.\\u201d In addition to violating the CDA, Airbnb also argues that the law violates the First Amendment rights of the company and its users. Airbnb has similar lawsuits against the cities of San Francisco, Anaheim and Santa Monica. The lawsuit is an about-face for the company, which just two days ago offered to work with the city of New York to address concerns about Airbnb\\u2019s impact on affordable housing. Airbnb proposed several new rules for hosts, including a \\u201cthree strikes\\u201d rule that would boot hosts from the platform if they listed illegal units three times.\\xa0Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsored the legislation, called Airbnb\\u2019s olive branch \\u201cpreposterous\\u201d and a \\u201cPR stunt.\\u201d \\u201cIn typical fashion, Albany back-room dealing rewarded a special interest \\u2014 the price-gouging hotel industry \\u2014 and ignored the voices of tens of thousands of New Yorkers. A majority of New Yorkers have embraced home sharing, and we will continue to fight for a smart policy solution that works for the people, not the powerful,\\u201d Airbnb\\u2019s head of New York public policy Josh Meltzer said in a statement. Meanwhile, the ShareBetter Coalition praised Cuomo for signing the legislation. \\u201cAirbnb has broken the law for years, making billions off their exploitation of the housing market while tenants have paid the price with higher rents and less affordable housing. This bill will give law enforcement the tools they need to crack down on illegal short-term rentals that deprive our neighborhoods of precious units of affordable housing and destabilize our communities,\\u201d the Coalition said in a statement.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/23/weengs/',\n",
       "  u'Weengs , a U.K. startup that has developed a shipping service for small retailers and online sellers that takes care of the hand and leg work (quite literally) required to send out orders, has picked up \\xa32.2 million in backing. It plans to use the capital to expand beyond London, including other cities in Europe. Backing the seed round are Robin and Saul Klein\\u2019s LocalGlobe, Seedcamp , and Germany\\u2019s Cherry Ventures . A number of unnamed angels also participated, in addition to Greek VC fund VentureFriends. Prior to today\\u2019s funding, Weengs, which launched in July 2015, had raised a mere \\xa3175,00 in angel funding. Aiming to take care of the most laborious and time-consuming aspect of selling goods online, Weengs offers a packaging and shipping service via a smartphone app: You simply take a photo of the items you want to send, add the destination address, and request a pickup. Then, within as little as an hour, one of Weeng\\u2019s so-called \\u201cAngels\\u201d \\u2014 not to be confused with the startup\\u2019s angel investors who I\\u2019m sure don\\u2019t get their hands that dirty \\u2014 will collect the item, take it to the startup\\u2019s warehouse where it is professionally packaged, including a custom-built box. Finally, the package is shipped via one of Weeng\\u2019s shipping partners, which include Royal Mail, DHL and DPD. It costs \\xa35 per pick up plus shipping rates. \\u201cSmall retailers and online sellers struggle to fulfill their online orders when it comes to packaging and shipping with a carrier. They have no resources or experience to offer the shipping services their big competitors offer which usually results in delayed deliveries or damages due to poor packing. We offer high-scale logistics to them at an affordable price,\\u201d explains Weeng co-founder Greg Zontanos. \\u201cWe collect their items unboxed from their location, package them professionally with our own materials and then ship them at discounted shipping rates with reliable carriers. This means our customers can promise same day shipping, deliver their goods intact and with great packaging and save themselves money and time. We also help them with international shipments so that they can address bigger markets; first by creating custom-built boxes and reducing shipping costs, and second by doing all the customs paperwork for them\\u201d. The business model is potentially neat, too. Aside from charging a pick up and packaging fee, which alone might set off a few unit economic alarm bells, some of Weeng\\u2019s margin lies in the discounted rates it can attain from its partner delivery companies through bulk purchasing, not all of which is passed on to customers. Of course, to make that really work scale will be the name of the game. To that end, Weeng\\u2019s typical customers are power Ebay sellers, and boutique stores, such as those listed on Trouva. \\u201cSuch a shop is usually being run by one or two people and they don\\u2019t have the time to find packing materials, do the packaging, book a label online and queue at the post office or arrange a collection within an 8-hour time window. All they need to do with Weengs is to take a photo\\u2026 with the Weengs app, add the destination address and request a pickup\\u201d Zontanos adds.',\n",

       "  u' Silicon Valley has not embraced Hillary Clinton in the same way it did Barack Obama. Donors from the Valley contributed just a third of what they gave in 2012 (roughly $3.3M vs. $8.8M by June of each respective election). And, even those donating millions of dollars have been quite explicit that their intention is mostly about stopping Donald Trump , while begrudgingly accepting an imperfect Democratic platform. Behind the less than enthusiastic embrace is a collective skepticism in the tech industry about Clinton\\u2019s pro-innovation credentials. The shade is unwarranted. There is a reasonably quantifiable way to forecast how innovation-friendly a candidate will be based on their legislative record: add up the percent of laws that a Congressman writes related to high-skilled workforce training, data transparency, and performance-based funding. An obsession with making the federal government run more like a tech company and training citizens to work in new industries is a good sign that a policymaker will end up siding with Silicon Valley on most issues. Indeed, Hillary Clinton is the latest in a long line of \\u201cNew Democrats\\u201d who have attempted to rebrand the party since the 90s as more tech friendly. Since her husband\\u2019s tenure in office, Silicon Valley insiders have recognized the supportive stance in the New Democrats\\u2019 fiscal policies. Indeed, many investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley heavily supported the Obama candidacy in 2008. That support was (on the whole) reciprocated by the President. And f inding evidence that Clinton is likely to pick up this mantle of technology booster isn\\u2019t difficult. Simply look at the percentage of bills the candidate authored in Congress related to technocratic management and skilled worker development. That should be a reasonable predictor of her friendliness toward Silicon Valley-supported policies. Let\\u2019s see how Clinton\\u2019s past stack\\u2019s up.  What kind of Democrat is Hillary Clinton? While Hillary Clinton may have adopted the egalitarian rhetoric of her populist primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, here is a taste of the innovation-centric bills she authored while in the Senate . This was very similar to the few technocratic laws that Obama authored while in the Senate . The debate over whether Clinton will be less innovation-friendly than Obama has been frustratingly subjective \\u2014 investors Silicon Valley just seem to get a bad feeling from Clinton\\u2019s populist rhetoric. But rhetoric is a tool of politicians, while legislation is an act of governance. Democrats rarely support \\u201cNew Democrat\\u201d-style tech-friendly laws and have a strong history of authoring new regulations to constrain the free market. That is, Democrats either prioritize economic growth and better management or they prioritize regulation \\u2014 but not both. Obama and Clinton authored laws that almost exclusively focused on skill development and improved government management while in the Senate. Why can\\u2019t Democrats focus on both innovation and regulation? The Democratic base is actually composed of two broadly defined and distinct constituencies: urbanized highly-educated professionals and middle America blue-collar workers. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a mass exodus of professionals, such as doctors and engineers, from Reagan\\u2019s Republican Party, when just 34% of professionals voted Democrats during Nixon\\u2019s election to over 50% in the 90s in Bill Clinton\\u2019s. Al From, who helped create the New Democrat coalition in the 80s, told me, \\u201cWith our economic growth agenda (fiscal discipline, investment in people and technology, and expanded trade), we also tapped into and built new Democratic constituencies in technology and finance.\\u201d This new base was no accident and neither was the new agenda. Twenty years after Bill Clinton\\u2019s reformation of the party, t he Clintons remain representative of this professional class of Democrat. Fascinatingly enough, this split within the Democratic Party goes back over 150 years. The first major schism in what is now the modern Democratic party appeared in the 1840s, when upstart frontier professionals in the West teamed up with the high skilled industry of the day, railroads, to advocate for free trade and investment in infrastructure. This so-called \\u201c Young America \\u201d movement would eventually take over the party with the election of President James K. Polk, who helped radically overhaul America\\u2019s once-isolationist trade policy. So should Silicon Valley be optimistic for Clinton as President? In private, a number of very wealthy former Barack Obama donors say that they are anxious that Clinton\\u2019s populist rhetoric portends a presidency that will not be friendly on emerging issues. For instance, Clinton now conditionally opposes the trans-pacific partnership; spoke negatively of charter schools in front of a teacher\\u2019s union rally; and made ambiguous statements on whether independent contractors in the gig economy should have to be treated like regular workers (which could be devastating to a company like Uber). In off-the-record conversations, Clinton\\u2019s tech policy team said that her words were gravely misinterpreted and she has no plans to regulate Uber or take any positions that threaten the tech industry. Without position statements one way or the other, it\\u2019s hard to say. But one good indication that she\\u2019ll stay loyal to her roots is how she has conceded to Bernie Sanders on one issue: higher education . It was widely reported that Clinton appeased the populist base by proposing a free college education plan like her former opponent. But \\u2014 and this is crucial \\u2014 the details of her plan are incredibly tech-friendly. Her proposal calls to create an entirely new way to fund college by incentivizing students to become entrepreneurs in distressed communities. Her plan also requires colleges to do something that many colleges have resisted: offer lower-priced versions of classes through online education. Indeed, the publication Inside Higher Ed declared that Clinton\\u2019s education plan was \\u201c giveaway to Silicon Valley \\u201c. So, will Hillary Clinton be as good for innovation has Barack Obama? Beyond the rhetoric, it\\u2019s hard to find evidence to the contrary. The Ferenstein Wire is a syndicated column.

       "  u' The NFL has a distinguished history of successful partnerships with upstart media companies. When it became the home of Sunday Night Football in 1987, ESPN\\u2019s unprecedented growth accelerated. Then, in 1993, the NFL sold its NFC Sunday afternoon package to Fox, firmly establishing it as the fourth major broadcast network in the U.S. In turn, both deals expanded the NFL\\u2019s reach and significantly increased its media rights revenue. This fall the NFL is working with another new media partner: Twitter. In a $10 million deal, Twitter is live streaming for free 10 Thursday Night Football (TNF) games. It is part of Twitter\\u2019s overall strategy of making live events the centerpiece of its platform. For its part, the NFL reportedly passed on higher bidders for the digital TNF package to test new distribution models with a trusted partner. Twitter faces some inherent limitations with the deal: it is only one year, the TNF broadcast is simulcast on CBS (or NBC) and the NFL Network and it can only sell a small percentage of the ad inventory. However, Twitter can position itself for its own long-term transformative NFL moment if the following happens this season: Twitter\\u2019s live stream offers a compelling vision for how people will watch and participate in live events in an OTT world. The BAMTech-powered HD broadcast has been a hit so far, but because it is the same broadcast as the linear networks, Twitter has an opportunity to showcase why the viewing experience is better on its platform. The curated tweets\\xa0alongside the action are a promising start. If Twitter can enable fans to personalize their experience, participate in meaningful ways and maybe even monitor their fantasy teams, it could convince fans, content owners and advertisers that it should be the premier destination for live sports on any device. Twitter acquires new users and drives both new and existing users to spend more time on the platform. Offering a premium product for free and without requiring a sign-up is undoubtedly an attractive proposition. More than 2 million people tuned in for the first game. The questions include: Are these existing Twitter users? If not, how will Twitter convert them into users? Moreover, how will Twitter convince both new and existing users to keep coming back? If Twitter can translate the traffic into new users and increased usage, the $1 million per game rights fee it is paying could very well be an efficient marketing expense. Twitter demonstrates the relationship between activity on its platform and media consumption. With its NFL streams, there\\u2019s no question Twitter will sell more video advertising year-over-year. The longer-term revenue opportunity is for the company to determine the degree to which tweets drive media consumption. This question has vexed the media industry for years. Now with games on their platform, Twitter should have the data to understand the effect of people and brands tweeting about a game, leading to answers that could persuade media buyers to spend more on Twitter advertising. On the surface, Twitter stands to gain the most from this partnership, given the current state of its business relative to the NFL, which took in a healthy $12 billion in revenue last year. But that doesn\\u2019t mean this experiment is of little value to the NFL. The NFL is gaining further insight into structuring and pricing its lucrative media rights\\xa0portfolio for the future. The league\\u2019s executive vice president of media, Brian Rolapp, has spoken of the Thursday Night Football linear and digital package as a form of risk capital . With the majority of its content locked into multiyear rights agreements, the league has experimented with different models and partners, with this year arguably the boldest test of all. Moreover, selling rights to a non-traditional media company like Twitter opens up the bidding process to a host of new potential partners, creating more competition for NFL rights and thus driving up the cost. In addition, the NFL will better understand how fans consume their content on a variety of platforms. The TNF package is a cross-media research petri dish, with the live games available simultaneously across a number of networks, platforms and devices. Understanding where and how fans watch live games will help the league optimize its programming, marketing and distribution strategies. The NFL and Twitter partnership is the latest grand experiment in the future of television. Regardless of the results, the deal is representative of three ongoing trends in the industry. First, social platforms like Twitter are media companies. In the quest for big television ad budgets, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat are all acquiring and/or producing premium video content. Second, content creators like the NFL are diversifying their distribution models as viewer behavior changes. And, third, live sports content is and will continue to be a powerful innovation driver for the media business. The NFL on Twitter this season will be a sight to behold. The games should be pretty entertaining, too.',\n",

       "  u' Artificial intelligence allows machines to reason and interact with the world, and it\\u2019s evolving at a breakneck pace. It\\u2019s already driving our cars, managing our health and even competing with \\u2014 and sometimes beating at our on games \\u2014 our best and most talented humans. Many advances in AI can be attributed to machine learning, which works by tapping massive computing power to crunch through enormous amounts of digitized data. Now consider that most of our data, the best minds in the business and more computing power than you could ever imagine sit with just a handful of companies. For these reasons, only a few companies in the world are best situated to understand the true potential \\u2014 and the current limits \\u2014 of AI. In response to AIs rapid developments, more than 8,000 leading researchers and scientists \\u2014 including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking \\u2014 have signed an open letter alluding to AI\\u2019s potential pitfalls and possible detriment to humanity. Their main concern is that an existential risk faces humanity: an AI in control of autonomous weapons . The letter goes on to state that autonomous weapons are quickly becoming the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms, and that AI researchers must focus their research on what is beneficial for humanity, and not just what is profitable. However, much of what is researched with AI may not be public knowledge, and is likely internal research that\\u2019s closely held by just a few very wealthy corporations. How can the public make informed decisions about something that is kept secret? Luckily, there are many who are willing to help us understand the current and future potential of AI for the benefit of humanity. These folks include recent nonprofits such as The Future of Life Institute and OpenAI , with notable donors including Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. OpenAI\\u2019s mission is: OpenAI\\u2019s technical goals go on to state that they are out to solve a general AI, or an AI that can perform any task, and perhaps develop a body to go along with it. They\\u2019ve hired many notable AI experts, and raised $1 billion in investment in 2015. OpenAI certainly has the talent to move things forward, but can a nonprofit really keep up with massive corporate innovation? If so, they\\u2019ll need to excel at the two major developments that have made machine learning a success: the exponential increase in computing power, and access to massive amounts of data. To help provide access to the computing power, they\\u2019ll need, NVIDIA , a graphics chip manufacturer specializing in optimized ML hardware and software, that just delivered their first supercomputer to OpenAI \\u2014 a $129,000 machine known as the world\\u2019s first deep learning supercomputer in a box. Of course, it\\u2019s not hard to imagine that Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook have many more orders of magnitudes of computing power than any one machine could have. That\\u2019s not to suggest that these corporations are hiding their computing power. Instead, Google for example, has open-sourced its AI library, called TensorFlow , and is quickly scaling its online cloud computing platform to enable access to state of the art equipment to include clusters of NVIDIA hardware. More worrisome for OpenAI than keeping up with corporate computing power, however, is being able to access the same data. Every ML algorithm requires data to learn \\u2014 enough data to generalize well enough to the scope of the population. Plenty of data sets for ML have been available since the early 1990s. However, it\\u2019s only in the last few years that our digital sharing economy has enabled mass collection of our personal data and behaviors, something an AI needs in order to learn. OpenAI, on the other hand, has no users to mine for data, so it must rely solely on open data sources. Another potential concern is that OpenAI is co-chaired by Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and Sam Altman , president of Y Combinator . Will their own companies take advantage of an all-star AI research team with billions of dollars in funding? And will OpenAI employees even care if they are given stock options in Y Combinator and soon SpaceX? Regardless of potential pitfalls, OpenAI is the only nonprofit organization dedicating itself to the humane development of AI. Now that AI is becoming more general, its developments are already surprising us. A nonprofit led by the brightest minds sounds like exactly what the world needs to help us understand the future of AI, and to lead the way toward a positive impact on society. Rather than a corporate-driven scenario, where AI could be used for the financial advantage of a select few, the nonprofit recognizes the potential for AI to develop a better future for all. That includes medical applications that will save lives, cars that will reduce accidents and a general AI that can benefit humanity.',\n",

       "  u' California lawmakers and regulators just conditionally approved the road-testing of high autonomy cars that require no driver or even human controls, becoming the first state in the nation to flesh out an innovation-nurturing framework after federal regulators last month gave the green light to driverless technology. Only nine states \\u2014eight by legislation, another by executive action, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures\\u2014have established a regulatory framework, even loose, for autonomous vehicles. But none compare to the California scheme, which allows for technologists to take the next step by entirely removing human drivers. Now, it\\u2019s not often you find a former aide to Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush praising California red tape. And yet here I am. To date, even the most audacious pilot programs, like Uber\\u2019s fleet of commercial autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania, require the presence of a safety driver who can assume control in the event of a dynamic situation that overwhelms the car\\u2019s mapping and radar systems. The US Department of Transportation rates driverless cars like those in Uber\\u2019s road test (i.e., with conditional automation technology that allows the car to manage most operations but still requires a human safety fallback) at the third of its six levels of automation , based on a scheme developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (known today simply as SAE), with Level 0 representing complete human control and Level 5 representing complete robotic control. The announcement last month that the federal government was broadly supportive of driverless cars warmed what had been something of a cold war among the states on driverless experimentation. So what was once cold is today hot: technologists and state lawmakers alike are now shooting for the moon, moving beyond the already-adventuresome Level 3 autonomy of Uber\\u2019s Pittsburgh pilot to as-yet-undeveloped Levels 4 and 5. Within days of the DOT unveiling its new policy guidance, the Governor of California signed into law a first-of-its-kind bill allowing the operation of robotic-operated autonomous vehicles at specially designated public sites in the Bay area. A day later, the California Department of Motor Vehicles independently released draft regulations allowing for federally approved cars that lack human controls (i.e., steering wheels and pedals for accelerating and braking). The practical effect of the feds\\u2019 new framework, which more closely resembles a loose best practices guide for the states than a cohesive national plan, will be a regulatory arms race among the states and the major regulatory jurisdictions within each\\u2013how best to address interstate travel amid a complex matrix of discordant laws ; how to settle passenger liability in autonomous taxis ; and whether to remove outmoded laws that would impede adoption, like anti-platooning rules or those requiring the presence of one hand on the steering wheel . What, for example, happens when a California operator (that is to say, the passenger) of an autonomous vehicle without human controls crosses the Golden State\\u2019s border and veers into Oregon, which has zero autonomous vehicle laws on the books? Good question\\u2014and one for which we don\\u2019t immediately have an answer. What immediately clear is that a mishmash of varying rules and competing degrees of acceptance among the states won\\u2019t help to foster widespread adoption of this 21st-century technology. Whether manufacturers can satisfy the imperative to bring the states into general alignment\\u2014a lobbying campaign of unprecedented scope to roll back outmoded laws and to adopt cohesive liability laws\\u2014is the single greatest hurdle to mass market adoption of driverless cars. Too often, questions about regulation\\u2014about when, where and how to unroll the red tape\\u2014are framed as a binary choice between innovators and regulators, progress and stagnation. But the truth is that smart, cohesive regulation, such as California\\u2019s, will empower the autonomous vehicle space by cultivating consumer confidence in a technology that, until recently, seemed impossibly futuristic. States must work in concert\\u2014with each other, with the federal government, and indeed with the\\xa0industry itself\\u2014to forge a deliberate, cohesive national framework that ensures the safety of consumers and the public, while also fostering innovation. California\\u2019s speeding down that road. ',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/23/what-we-learned-about-elon-musks-mars-plan-in-his-reddit-ama/',\n",
       "  u'Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, hosted a Reddit \\u201cAsk Me Anything\\u201d this afternoon. He noted that the AMA should focus on SpaceX\\u2019s plans for Mars, which Musk revealed during the International Astronautical Congress last month. Overall, Musk mostly answered questions about SpaceX\\u2019s plan to colonize Mars and the technology required to get there. He stated that their Interplanetary Transit System (ITS) would be powerful enough to travel back to Earth after landing on Mars at any point during Earth and Mars\\u2019 orbits. This is a feature particularly useful for human missions where emergencies may arise and an immediate mission to or from Mars may be necessary for survival. Musk mentioned that one of the biggest ITS challenges they\\u2019re working on right now is finding a way to properly seal their carbon fiber tanks in the ITS booster. Building large rocket parts out of carbon fiber is relatively new, so SpaceX is currently working through tests with a carbon fiber ITS oxygen tank model. Other interesting AMA revelations are detailed below.  SpaceX\\u2019s Mars Plan In a few different questions, Musk was asked more about what the SpaceX Mars plan would actually look like. He explained that the first missions to Mars would involve the SpaceX Red Dragon capsule without crew. These would be scouting missions designed to test their landing technology as well as their in situ resource utilization capability. Then the ITS spaceship, otherwise known as the Heart of Gold spaceship, will fly to Mars with equipment required for a Mars-based propellant plant. Next, the first crewed mission, which will have about a dozen people, will fly to Mars to troubleshoot the propellant plant as well as the Mars Base Alpha power system. Eventually, Musk said, SpaceX plans to double the number of flights each time Mars and Earth become closest to each other, which happens every 26 months. This synodic period between Mars and Earth actually becomes a challenge when you consider that it may not always be convenient to travel between these planets during this window. For risk-averse agencies like NASA, this small window is restrictive and a bit scary. What if you have an emergency on Mars a month after you land and need to return to Earth? Well, one Reddit user pointed out that the SpaceX ITS system appeared to have enough power to make those types of emergency missions, if necessary. The user asked if the ITS spaceship could \\u201cbe used to fly between Mars and Earth even outside the launch windows enforced by the synodic period, when payload mass is not a primary factor? It could be used for emergency purposes such as medical supplies/instruments and experts, or for other high priority but low mass cargo like critical replacements.\\u201d Musk replied with a simple \\u201cyes.\\u201d Musk also reaffirmed what many in the Reddit community already pointed out , which was that SpaceX\\u2019s carbon fiber oxygen tank for ITS was really the star of his IAC presentation. Making large parts out of carbon fiber is a very challenging thing to do, so the fact that SpaceX seems to have already built a full-size carbon fiber tank for their ITS was a pretty big deal. Mars Bound Technology Interplanetary Transit System (ITS) SpaceX\\u2019s Interplanetary Transit System consists of a booster, and a spaceship. When it comes to the robustness of ITS, Musk noted that the ITS spaceship could handle peak loads of 10 to 15 g\\u2019s without breaking up. He went on to say that the ITS booster would work nominally under 20 g\\u2019s but might be able to handle 30 to 40 g\\u2019s without breaking up. For reference, a nominal reentry for the Space Shuttle went through a max of about 3 g\\u2019s during launch or reentry. ITS Booster One Reddit user pointed out that the ITS booster can hover and asked if SpaceX ever planned to use that capability. Musk said that it wasn\\u2019t likely. ITS Spaceship When asked what the interior of the spaceship will look like, Musk said that they plan to release live mockups of the spaceship in a year or two. Raptor Engine When asked about the major challenges that need to be overcome for his Mars plan to be successful, Musk said that the biggest challenge originally was finding the right material to make the ITS engine out of. Now, he said, the biggest challenge is to seal their carbon fiber tanks (located in the ITS booster) properly.  Falcon 9 Reusability And on a non-Mars topic, Musk was asked about the reusability of the Falcon 9 rockets currently flying. He stated \\u201cI think the F9 boosters could be used almost indefinitely, so long as there is scheduled maintenance and careful inspections.\\u201d He emphasized that the current Falcon 9 rockets in production would be retired soon and that their next version would be designed for easy reuse. The new Falcon 9, which he calls \\u201cFalcon 9 Block 5\\u201d \\u2013 the fifth and final version in the Falcon series, is scheduled to have its first flight in six to eight months.  ',\n",

       "  u'The 2013 Snowden documents revealed\\xa0UK intelligence agency GCHQ to be tapping into the undersea cables that carry Internet traffic ,\\xa0covertly\\xa0gathering vast amounts of digital comms data under a\\xa0surveillance program code-named Tempora \\u2014 apparently with the help of commercial partners. Now leaked documents obtained by The Intercept confirm GCHQ paid New Zealand-based Endace to\\xa0create data capture systems to\\xa0enable it to\\xa0tap high speed\\xa0Internet traffic. Endace\\u2019s website touts its ability to offer \\u201c100% accurate network recording, any speed, any network\\u201d, going on to note: It\\xa0also notes the company\\xa0does business with: Endace\\u2019s name has previously been linked to state surveillance via a 2011 WikiLeaks dump of brochures and marketing materials from the companies seeking to sell services to spy agencies. But the new cache of documents detail specific purchases and product requirements, such as a\\xa0\\xa3245,000 charge\\xa0in a statement of work dated February 2010 to accelerate \\u201cfeature enhancements\\u201d to certain of its data capture and monitoring products which it says have been \\u201cidentified\\u201d in discussions with GCHQ. The document\\xa0adds that the majority of these enhancement are \\u201cof a bespoke nature\\u201d and would not otherwise have formed part of its planned commercial roadmap for the unit. The cache of internal documents include emails, customer lists, project updates, product overviews, contracts and financial reports. TVNZ has also reported on the documents, which were leaked to The Intercept via the open source whistleblower submission site, SecureDrop . They underline how\\xa0GCHQ was pushing to ramp up its surveillance capabilities. The Intercept notes that as of 2009 the agency\\xa0was tapping into 87 different 10Gbps capacity cables but by March 2011 it\\xa0wanted to beef that up to 415 cables. While an earlier\\xa0July 2010 document, setting out its vision for 2013, describes its\\xa0ambition to \\u201cgrow our Internet access to 800 10Gs \\u201c. In one contract with\\xa0GCHQ Endace is revealed to have been bound to\\xa0the UK\\u2019s Official Secrets Act \\u2014 thereby enforcing non-disclosure of its\\xa0contract with the spy agency. The leaked documents also reveal Endace\\xa0used\\xa0New Zealand government research funding to develop certain\\xa0surveillance products for GCHQ. Endace was founded in New Zealand back in 2001, spun out of an academic research project. The company was acquired by California-based Emulex in 2015 but earlier this year a management-led buyout spun it back out , as a private company. In a statement at the time CEO Stuart Wilson said: \\u201cOperating as an independent company again allows us to continue to deliver innovative solutions to our customers under the Endace brand they\\u2019ve known and trusted for more than 15 years.\\u201d So you want to\\xa0data-mine a popular chat app\\u2026 In another\\xa0of the leaked documents, a 2013 proof of concept overview for\\xa0a product\\xa0called Kraken \\u2014 which the company described\\xa0as \\u201caimed at solving the deep storage problem faced by network analytics users\\u201d \\u2014\\xa0Endace gives several sample customer user stories, including a scenario in which a \\u2018Friendly Government Agency\\u2019 (FGA) \\u201chas the encryption keys for a well-known chat program\\u201d and wants to unencrypt all packets set on the network in the last 24 hours to look for a particular text string \\u2014 Elsewhere in the documents the company switches between referring to FGA and GCHQ, heavily implying FGA is its\\xa0internal code-name for GCHQ. And while it\\u2019s not clear how true-to-life that particular\\xa0customer user story is, with its apparently jokey reference to Domino\\u2019s Pizza as the preferred food of terrorists, the general thrust of the capability request is presumably exactly what GCHQ was\\xa0after at that point \\u2014 which was in turn driving\\xa0Endace\\u2019s product development decisions. Another data capture product being developed by Endace\\xa0with\\xa0GCHQ\\u2019s requirements in mind, code-named Medusa , was designed\\xa0to enable data traveling at up to 100Gbps to be intercepted. The first version of the tech\\xa0was apparently delivered to the spy agency in November 2011, after which they requested some additional capabilities\\xa0\\u2014 including a feature described as \\u201cSeparate MAC insertion by IP type\\u201d, perhaps seeking the ability to target individuals via the hardware addresses of their devices. In addition to selling tech to enable GCHQ to tap fibre optic cables at high speed\\xa0and massive scale, the documents reveal Endace selling surveillance-enabling technology to a raft of other government agencies and bodies, including in the U.S. and Canada, Israel, Denmark, Spain, Morocco, India and Australia. In the\\xa0Moroccan instance, The Intercept notes the particular security agency in question \\u2014 the DGST \\u2014 has been\\xa0implicated\\xa0in torture. Endace is also revealed to have a large number of\\xa0telecoms customers\\xa0\\u2014 including\\xa0AT&T, AOL*, Verizon**, Sprint, Cogent Communications, Telstra, Belgacom, Swisscom, Deutsche Telekom, Telena Italy, Vastech South Africa, and France Telecom \\u2014 and also finance giants on its customer lists, such as\\xa0Morgan Stanley, Reuters and Bank of America. The Intercept flags\\xa0another document which details another strand of its\\xa0business is providing a \\u201clawful intercept\\u201d product, in this case to US telco Sprint \\u2014 likely as part of a legal requirement that telcos have an intercept capability for equipment on their networks in order that they can provide extracted data to law enforcement and security agencies on request. That said, Endace does also sell network monitoring equipment to companies wanting to check and maintain\\xa0their own networks \\u2014 including to help investigate\\xa0data breaches and network security incidents. One such customer there is HealthShare NZ . On the finance side, its website also notes providing financial companies with monitoring technology to help \\u201chigh-frequency traders to monitor, measure, and analyze critical network environments\\u201d. *TechCrunch\\u2019s parent company **The parent company of TechCrunch\\u2019s parent company',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/23/wtf-is-machine-learning/',\n",
       "  u'While the number of headlines about machine learning might lead one to think that\\xa0we just discovered something profoundly new, the reality is that the technology\\xa0is nearly as old as computing. It\\u2019s no coincidence that Alan Turing, one of the most influential\\xa0computer scientists of all time, started his 1950\\xa0treatise\\xa0on computing with the question\\xa0\\u201cCan machines think?\\u201d From our science fiction to our research labs, we have long questioned whether the\\xa0creation of artificial versions of ourselves will somehow help us uncover the origin of our own consciousness, and\\xa0more broadly, our role on earth. Unfortunately, the learning curve on AI is really damn\\xa0steep. By tracing a bit of history, we should hopefully be able to get to the bottom of wtf machine learning really is. Our first attempts at replicating ourselves\\xa0involved jamming machines full of information and hoping for the best. Seriously, there was a time when the prevailing theory of consciousness was that it could arise from just a ton of information connected together.\\xa0Google could be seen by some as the culmination of this vision, but while the company\\xa0has indexed 30 trillion webpages, I don\\u2019t think anyone expects our search engines to start asking us if there is a god. Rather, the beauty of machine learning\\xa0is that instead of pretending computers are human and simply feeding them with\\xa0knowledge, we help\\xa0computers to reason and then let them\\xa0generalize what they\\u2019ve learned to new information. While not well understood,\\xa0neural networks, deep learning, and reinforcement learning are all machine learning. They\\u2019re all methods of creating generalized systems that can perform analysis on new\\xa0data. Put a different way, machine learning is one of many artificial intelligence techniques, and things like neural networks and deep learning are just tools that can be used to build better frameworks with broader\\xa0applications. Back in the 50s,\\xa0our computing power was limited, we didn\\u2019t have access to big-data, and our algorithms were rudimentary. This meant that our ability to advance machine learning research was quite limited. However, that didn\\u2019t stop people from\\xa0trying. Back in 1952, Arthur Samuel made a chess program using a very basic form of AI\\xa0called alpha beta pruning. This is a method for reducing computational load when working with search trees that represent data, but it\\u2019s not always the best strategy for every problem.  Even neural networks showed their face in yesteryear with\\xa0Frank Rosenblatt\\u2019s perceptron. The perceptron was way ahead of its time, leveraging neuroscience to advance machine learning. On paper, the idea looked something like the sketch to the right. To understand what it\\u2019s doing, you first have to understand that most machine learning problems\\xa0can be broken down into either classification or regression.\\xa0Classifiers are used to categorize data, while regression models broadly deal with extrapolating out trends to make predictions. The perceptron is an example of a classifier \\u2014 it takes a set of data and splits it into multiple sets. In this case, the existence of two traits with respective weights is enough for this object to be classified in the \\u201cgreen\\u201d category. Classifiers today separate the spam from your inbox and detect fraud for your bank. Rosenblatt\\u2019s model uses a\\xa0series of inputs, think features like length, weight, color, and assigns each of them a weight. The model then continuously adjusts the weights until an output is reached that falls within\\xa0an accepted margin of error. For example,\\xa0one could input that the weight of an object that happens to be an apple\\xa0is 100 grams. The computer doesn\\u2019t know it\\u2019s an apple, but the perceptron can classify the object as an apple-like-object or a non-apple-like-object by adjusting the classifier\\u2019s weights\\xa0with respect to a known training set of data. Once the classifier has been tuned, it can ideally be reused on a data set it has never been exposed to before to classify unknown objects. The perceptron is just one example of many early advances made in machine learning. Neural networks are sort of like big collections of perceptrons working together, a lot like how our brains and neurons work, which is where the name comes from. Skipping forward a few decades, advancements in AI have continued to be\\xa0about replicating the way the mind works rather than simply replicating what we perceive its\\xa0contents to be. Basic, or \\u201cshallow\\u201d, neural networks are still in use today, but deep learning has caught on as the next big thing. Deep learning\\xa0models are neural networks with more layers. A totally reasonable\\xa0reaction to this incredibly unsatisfying explanation is to ask what I mean by layers. To understand this, we have to remember that just because we say a computer can organize\\xa0cats and humans into two different groups, the computer itself doesn\\u2019t process the task the same way a human would. Machine learning frameworks take advantage of the idea of abstraction to accomplish tasks. To a human, faces have eyes. To a computer, faces have pixels that are light and dark that make up some abstraction of lines. Each layer of a deep learning model lets the computer identify another level of abstraction of the same object. Pixels to lines to 2D to 3D geometry. This\\xa0fundamental difference in the way humans and computers evaluate the world presents a serious challenge to creating true artificial intelligence. The Turing test was conceptualized to evaluate our progress\\xa0in AI, but it largely ignores this reality. Turing\\u2019s test is a behaviorist test focused on\\xa0evaluating the ability of computers to emulate human output. However, mimicry and probabilistic reasoning are, at best, only part of the mystery of intelligence and consciousness. Some believe we successfully passed the Turing test in 2014, when a machine convinced 10 out of\\xa030 scientists that it was human during a five minute keyboard conversation (and yet\\xa0Siri still tries to search Google for every third thing we ask her). Despite progress, scientists and entrepreneurs alike have been quick to over-promise the capabilities of AI. The resulting boom and bust cycles are commonly referred to as AI winters. We have been able to do some unbelievable things with machine learning, like classify objects in video footage for autonomous cars and predict crop yields with satellite imagery. Long short-term memory is helping our machines deal with time-series for things like sentiment analysis in videos. Reinforcement learning, takes ideas from game theory, and includes a mechanism to assist learning through rewards. Reinforcement learning was a key part of how Alpha Go was able to upset Lee Sodol. That said, despite all progress, the great secret of machine learning is that while we usually\\xa0know the inputs and outputs of a given problem, and the explicitly programmed code to act as the intermediary, we can\\u2019t\\xa0always identify how the model is going from input to output.\\xa0Researchers refer to this challenge as\\xa0the\\xa0black box problem of machine learning. Before getting too discouraged, we must remember that the human brain itself is a black box. We don\\u2019t really know how it works and cannot examine it at all levels of abstraction. I would be labeled crazy if I asked you to dissect a brain and point to the memories held within it. However, not being able to understand something isn\\u2019t game over, it\\u2019s game on. This post introduced many of the basic concepts underpinning machine learning but leaves plenty on the table for future WTF is pieces. Deep learning, reinforcement learning and neural nets could all\\xa0stand on their own but hopefully after reading this post you can visualize the field itself and draw connections to many of the companies we cover daily\\xa0on TechCrunch.

       "  u'Do you work in software? Do you have more than a decade of experience? You do? I\\u2019m sorry to hear that. That means there\\u2019s a strong possibility that much of what you know is already obsolete. Worse yet, there\\u2019s a good chance that you\\u2019re set in anachronistic ways, hidebound with habits which are now considered harmful. If you think your experience is automatically valuable, I warn you: think again. To be clear, I am not arguing in favor of age discrimination , which is wrong, illegal, and stupid. (Some of the finest engineers I\\u2019ve ever known, who anyone would be happy to hire in a heartbeat, are in their 50s.) I am , however, arguing that tech\\u2019s ever-accelerating pace of change means that people tend to greatly overestimate the value of their experience, the returns from which diminish every year. People say \\u201cthe principles remain the same, you just apply them to different tools / in different environments\\u201d \\u2014 but that\\u2019s, at best, a falsely comforting half-truth. Consider: back in the day, object-oriented development was the solution to all of our problems; now it\\u2019s a problem to which many solutions are proposed. Once upon a time, every web developer knew, axiomatically, that you never mixed HTML and JavaScript, because of separation of concerns ; but then came React . The status quo isn\\u2019t going to stabilize any time soon. Around the world, veteran developers with \\u201cvaluable\\u201d experience are already being asked, with honest bafflement: \\u201cWait, why are you trying to write an algorithm for this? Why not just train a model in TensorFlow?\\u201d I don\\u2019t mean to imply that all knowledge and experience becomes worthless. Some lessons, and some well-developed instincts, are indeed very nearly universal. Some platforms \\u2014 Android, iOS, containers in the cloud, etc. \\u2014 will be around long enough, and accumulate changes slowly enough, that their understanding will be valuable for a long while yet. But there has still been a significant sea change. The de facto assumption for most of the twentieth century was that experience was assumed high-value unless proven otherwise. In technology, in software, this is no longer the case. Increasingly, instead, your experience beyond a certain point \\u2014 say, 5-10 years, depending on many factors \\u2014 is assumed low-value unless proven otherwise. This doesn\\u2019t only apply to hard technical skills. Managing people scattered across six time zones via Slack and Google Hangouts is very different from managing in person; managing in a high-growth startup is very different from managing in a large static company. Whether you\\u2019re a developer, DevOps, or a manager, you never get to stop having to constantly prove yourself. That is the nature of the tech beast. The most important skill, one that truly doesn\\u2019t get old, is the meta-skill of constantly learning new things \\u2026 and that meta-skill can rust and wither away, too, if it languishes unused. If you\\u2019ve been doing the very same thing at work for the last few years, without working on any side projects of your own, then I am sorry to report that your career is already rotting away from within, without you even knowing it. Don\\u2019t let that happen. \\u201c Stay hungry, stay foolish .\\u201d That isn\\u2019t just good advice; these days, it\\u2019s an imperative.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/23/honeycombtv/',\n",
       "  u'Honeycomb , a TV and video ad management platform founded by James Carpenter and Richard Carter, who both previously founded Adstream, has raised \\xa33 million in Series A funding. It follows a \\xa31 million \\u201cfriends and family\\u201d round in May this year. Leading the Series A is U.K. and U.S.-based VC Beringea, along with a number of individuals from the worlds of television and advertising. The latter includes David Bell (a senior adviser to AOL and Verizon, and former Senior Advisor to Google), Richard Jameson (the former CFO of brand services company Tag-worldwide), and John Spearman (Chairman of visual effects company Framestore). Officially launched in August, Honeycomb\\u2019s platform streamlines the process of TV and video ad delivery by automating elements of the submission process, which typically involves a lot of tedious data entry. I\\u2019m told that this results in numerous steps between the creative industries or post production houses and ads appearing on TV. But by utilising Honeycomb\\u2019s tech, creative agencies and post production houses can submit content in about half of the time or less, while the possibility of human error is reduced significantly. \\u201cThe process of getting a TV or video advert from the creative agency, post production house or similar, all the way to a broadcaster or online publisher is painful,\\u201d says Honeycomb\\u2019s Carpenter. \\u201cThere could be 30 steps in the process, across email, phone and even fax, all with the potential for human error. It\\u2019s slow, frustrating and expensive. Not only that, it hinders quality\\u201d. Honeycomb\\u2019s other key selling point is that, unlike leading competitors, including Carpenter and Carter\\u2019s former company Adstream, it charges the same amount for HD or SD content, meaning that advertisers don\\u2019t need to compromise picture quality. \\u201cOur competitors charge an inflated fee for High Definition content, and that\\u2019s per destination they send the content to, which can add up,\\u201d says Carpenter. \\u201cAs a result, creative agencies and their clients sometimes opt for Standard Definition versions of their advert, which can look poor when sandwiched between HD TV programmes\\u201d. However, in addition to automating elements of the submission process, the data sharing part of Honeycomb\\u2019s platform also lays the groundwork for the startup\\u2019s much more ambitious plans and, along with the track record of Honeycomb\\u2019s founders, is likely what attracted its VC backers. That is, the company wants to help usher in so-called programmative TV in the next two to three years. Explains Carpenter: \\u201cThis as yet unrealised \\u2018holy grail\\u2019 of TV advertising will allow media buyers to purchase TV ads based on audience data, rather than relying on ratings of individual shows and channels. We work with partners on the agency and broadcaster side to make sure that all interests are well covered. Our system allows that the adverts can be delivered basically fully automated to the \\u2018publisher\\u2019 with all the necessary metadata and then can be inserted in the matching media buckets with the right audience\\u201d.',\n",

       "  u' Later this year, Anthem, Cigna , Aetna and Humana will all argue their respective mergers don\\u2019t run afoul of antitrust laws. Aetna also announced it was pulling out of 538 of the 778 county health insurance exchanges in 2017 due to lack of profit potential. After a honeymoon period, corporate healthcare providers are measuring the Affordable Care Act\\u2019s (ACA) impact. PricewaterhouseCoopers reports consolidation is the top issue facing healthcare. The mandated expansion of coverage and cost control efforts have been through their first round of economic testing, and it appears consolidation \\u2014 in one form or another \\u2014 is the inevitable result. The economic theory behind the ACA was that better cost controls would come from fostering competition and ensuring consumers had enough leverage with insurers and healthcare providers. That market-driven theory\\u2019s logical conclusion is that the most efficient business model would have multiple insurance companies competing in a single, national market. You can attribute the ACA\\u2019s state-based solution, in part, to extreme partisan overreaction and historic preference for state-level regulation of insurance products. Currently, we have 50 markets and 51 regulators. Regardless of the culprit, the mechanism that added 20 million people to the insurance rolls also came with additional, and unnecessary, costs in the form of regulatory compliance and reporting. To be clear, there is a difference between a public option and nationalized healthcare. As some have pointed out , Congress could have fixed the ACA by deregulating across state lines. Others argue that we should skip a step and embrace the so-called public option. Both stir so much political anxiety that either course would likely mean starting back at square one. What\\u2019s gotten less attention is an idea that would actually fuse a national regulatory approach with a nationalized market-based solution. In effect, a healthcare wallet for all consumers, one that takes its cues on transparency and cost-cutting from some of tech\\u2019s biggest success stories. Primary care physicians manage every aspect of your health profile, and in many cases they are overqualified and not particularly invested in that workload. Routinely, our needs operate inside an entirely different dynamic. Most of the healthcare bundle today has more in common with calling a taxi than treating serious medical issues. Sprained ankles, common colds and other basic and intermediate issues are best addressed through on-demand, fully competent and affordable medical intermediaries. Much like how Uber creates a more efficient allocation for taxi capacity, a similar product \\u2014 perhaps, \\u201cUber for Urgent Care\\u201d \\u2014 could disrupt the basic and intermediate care model. According to PBS , Americans spend $1,000 per person per year on pharmaceuticals \\u2014 40 percent more than the next highest developed nation. Given the controversial EpiPen price hike , Mylan\\u2019s quick decision to sell the generic at half the price and reporting that shows just how inexpensive the product is to make , the law of supply and demand has minimal bearing on the market for pharmaceuticals. In fact, it\\u2019s not a market at all, given the wide disconnect between buyers and sellers. Americans are captive to the pharmaceutical industry, much like our past relationships with 20th century department stores. A national pharmaceutical distribution network resembling Amazon would rationalize the supply chain so that margins become less arbitrary and cost structures become market-driven based on a national scale. Transparency and, ultimately, more cross-border competition would result. Because we pay for a large portion of our pharmaceutical bill through our health insurance, a single market would erase the artificial lines that allow huge geographic price disparities. The Obamacare exchanges laid the groundwork for a consumer-centric healthcare model, but failed to adequately address the additional cost of increased patient load and compliance from the provider. If compliance was fixed to a single national standard and shifted to federal oversight, we\\u2019d likely see a larger version of Medicare. Unfortunately, Medicare is already burdened by excessive patient load because some providers don\\u2019t want to take on slow-paying and artificially discounted services that come from Medicare patients. If the system could rationalize the cost model on a national scale, the patient load across a broader range of service providers would likely stabilize, access would improve and increased competition would drive down costs. To accelerate this economic theory, also consider an eBay-style healthcare bidding system. If someone needs an appendectomy \\u2014 one of the most common surgeries in the U.S . \\u2014 they have few market options to research providers, price or efficacy. Through an eBay-style bidding system, insurance companies could give patients visibility into the services they purchase. Common procedures could be exposed to open market forces that set prices and allow patients to bid around those prices to achieve maximum value. Pricing and success metrics could be benchmarked by insurers that are in the unique position to understand the full cost of treatment for each procedure. Service levels would finally be scored, indexed and priced. Providers would earn better treatment (and payment) by the insurer based on delivering better service at a lower total cost of treatment. So, when do we get a national healthcare wallet? Venture capital recognizes the economic opportunity that exists in healthcare with the aging of baby boomers. They are aggressively directing resources to healthcare startups . Eventually, the products and services we incubate around healthcare will organize themselves into something market-based and logical \\u2014 a national healthcare wallet. Do we eliminate a fragmented state-by-state healthcare system, or do we continue to ignore it until it drains all of our discretionary assets and turns healthcare into a much larger national challenge?',\n",

       "  u' Square opened its point-of-sale platform to competitors. There are rumors that IBM will buy Revel. For anyone following the changes in payments and the restaurant industry, these are interesting strategic moves. Many of us have tried new services, like online food ordering, subscription meals and signing with your finger on a tablet-based point-of-sale system; but the reality is that we are still in the early phases of restaurant industry disruption. I believe that\\u2019s about to change. In a few years we will look back on these announcements as a major shift in the pace of disruption and the time we started to \\u201ccross the chasm\\u201d into a chapter of rapid deployment, consolidation and breakaway winners. So what has been happening in the restaurant industry? We can separate the disruption into two categories: how you get your food and how you pay for your food . And if you eat Soylent , then perhaps you can add what you call your food. But let\\u2019s focus on software-based disruption. Venture investors have invested almost $3 billion in startups that change how you get your food . Online ordering/delivery and meal subscription services have received 50 percent of the total, and are highly visible signs of change to consumers. They have even produced two unicorns: GrubHub (NYSE: GRUB) and Blue Apron . More than 10 million people have used GrubHub or one of its competitors and 400,000 receive weekly meals by mail from Blue Apron, Plated and others. While it\\u2019s too early to declare death to the home-cooked meal, clearly Americans like these options. These, however, are not the most disruptive changes.  Replacing the restaurant point-of-sale (POS) system is the real game. The POS is becoming the restaurant\\u2019s central nervous system, changing not just how you pay for your food , but how the restaurant runs its business. Square deserves much credit for leading the way to software-based POS systems; however, Square initially was more about electronifying cash for micro merchants than a new central nervous system. Other companies like Toast , Revel , ShopKeep and Clover get more credit for focusing on the restaurant owner\\u2019s business needs \\u2014 like menus, order routing and staffing \\u2014 while embedding payments as a \\u201cmere\\u201d feature in their software. Collectively, these startups are fueling profound change.\\xa0It starts with a device replacement and ends with a new industry order. First, like many other hardware devices that have been reduced to an app on your phone \\u2014 fax machines, cameras, flashlights \\u2014 the restaurant cash register is becoming an application on a phone or tablet. We are in a multi-year cycle of replacing proprietary POS systems from vendors like Oracle/Micros and NCR/Aloha with cloud-based, software applications that run on Android and iOS devices.  As the POS system becomes software, payments and (many)\\xa0restaurant functions can be delivered as SaaS applications, fundamentally changing the economics and distribution models.\\xa0For starters, SaaS startups can sell directly and often bypass the costly VARs that have long provided sales, service and integration for proprietary POS vendors. They also can leverage their software expertise to embed payment functionality and usurp the traditional roles and revenue stream of ISOs and payment gateway providers. Both traditionally earned interchange (the ~2.5 percent restaurants give up when we pay with a credit card), but the software POS startups gain access to this potent source of revenue to supplement and/or reduce SaaS license fees. Finally, because these startups are writing to standardized hardware \\u2014 especially in the case of Android \\u2014 they can ride the falling cost curves and pass along the savings to customers. Over time, these startups will achieve the ultimate disruption of becoming the industry platforms on which other restaurant applications are built. How helpful are online orders from GrubHub or loyalty programs from LevelUp if they don\\u2019t integrate closely with the POS. Some vendors, like First Data , which acquired Clover in 2012,\\xa0envision a full-on iTunes Store-like model and already sport ~200 in their store. Others, like Toast, see a NetSuite model, in which any developer can write to the platform, but some core applications are tightly integrated to ensure functionality. Either way, becoming a platform yields important strategic value for the vendor, as well as the industry, because more developers are free to create new applications. And this leads to the predicted jockeying by established players. First Data\\u2019s acquisition of Clover was small \\u2014 $56 million \\u2014 but if IBM buys Revel , one of the largest players in the space, then we have a clear sign of consolidation underway. Square\\u2019s move to open its platform is even more interesting and reminds me of the prescient moves by Amazon 15 years ago to leverage its e-commerce infrastructure to power third-party merchants. Square does not expect to beat every POS startup serving the restaurant sector, but it would like to sell them the lucrative services that leverage its scale, and virtuously reinforce its scale. Think payment processing, SMB financing and data analytics.\\xa0New motto? \\u201cOne Square to rule them all?\\u201d With the benefit of hindsight, the events that signal the start of true industry disruption are generally clear. I believe the actions by Square to open its POS platform to competitors and by IBM to consider acquiring Revel signal such a change for the restaurant industry. SaaS-based startups have turned payments and restaurant applications into a service and are now leveraging the ability to sell directly, monetize interchange revenue and ride the cost curves of industry-standard hardware. Entire categories of incumbent vendors are threatened, including VARs, ISOs and payment gateway providers. Through our investments in the space, we are seeing the tornado-like acceleration in deployments \\u2014 and I for one am very excited to see this play out!',\n",

       "  u' LUMAScapes map the constellations and clusters of the digital advertising universe. For many years, that universe, like our own, was ever-expanding. But also like our universe, there\\u2019s debate about whether it will continue to expand or end in a big crunch. I would argue the latter is happening \\u2014 and happening now. It\\u2019s been difficult for small adtech firms to raise capital for a while, and we are beginning to see the inevitable consequences of that capital shortage. In this respect, the adtech sector is due for a correction; I\\u2019m hardly alone in predicting it. But contrary to what you may have heard, that\\u2019s not because adtech is dead or dying. The industry just needs to shed dead weight. Dead weight in the form of small me-too companies , purveyors of point solutions and standalone tools for optimizing, verifying and measuring advertising. Undifferentiated companies with wide gaps between the narrative of what their tech does and the reality of the value that that tech provides. Dead weight in the form of companies founded within the last five years that are now burning through the last of their A rounds. That doesn\\u2019t mean the entire space of adtech is doomed, though. It\\u2019s just facing an important and overdue reckoning with the hard realities that face any business. Namely \\u2014 you have to be a well-run business, you have to add real value, solve real problems and have a path to profit. That\\u2019s true of any startup, in any space. I\\u2019m constantly asked what I think of adtech\\u2019s terrible reputation within the investment community. My response is the same: There are bad and good companies in any investment category, and innovation is still happening in this space. That said, there are characteristics of adtech that make it harder to separate the good from the bad. Adtech over the past few years bears a resemblance to the mortgage industry during the sub-prime days . Which is to say, a lack of transparency has contributed to an environment where a lot of people are throwing a lot of money around for short-term gain without a lot of concern for creating long-term value . Sooner or later, the truth emerges and all that cash gets vaporized. In the case of adtech, fraud has run rampant , and marketers have justly felt like they\\u2019ve often been throwing away money (because many of them have). In 2010, a marketer using a programmatic exchange would not expect to confirm that the ad would be seen by a human and not a bot (some two-thirds of them weren\\u2019t seen by humans), or be sure that the ad was actually viewable in the first place (about half of them were). We took those conditions for granted. Even Facebook, as savvy a customer as any, was fooled. The company bought video ad server LiveRail in 2014 for $400 million to $500 million . Two years later , Facebook effectively shut the company down with the rationale being that it couldn\\u2019t vouch for much of LiveRail\\u2019s traffic because it was rife with fraud. A market beset by such transparency issues was easy to exploit. You could put together an adtech startup without a great deal of tech \\u2014 just a lot of salesmanship: hire a sales team, have limited tech, resell a mix of good and suspect inventory and make money. That strategy is much less tenable these days. Transparency is increasing. Advertising is now checked for viewability, screened for non-human traffic and tied to actual sales performance by an increasingly sophisticated suite of measurement tools that look well beyond the click. With digital advertising climbing out of the shadows, it will be harder for me-too players to growth-hack their way to success by manufacturing scale. And it\\u2019s going to expose a lot of dead weight for what it is. It is indeed time for these smaller players to fall by the wayside. The question becomes, then, what\\u2019s left in the wake of this correction? The answer is simple: fewer, but healthier adtech companies, poised for growth and worthy of investment. Not all adtech businesses fit this description, but plenty do. Enough, indeed, to make the adtech space a lively and promising one for those businesses built on solid foundations, as well as for the investors smart enough to spot them. Criteo and The Trade Desk fit the bill. The latter just recently going public. As the company\\u2019s S-1 filing with the SEC outlines, The Trade Desk\\u2019s business is very healthy. In 2015, it posted $113.8 million in revenues, which was up 155.5 percent year-over-year. The company is also profitable, netting $39.2 million in EBITDA, which was up 589 percent. The company also has $37.6 million in cash on hand. Good adtech companies like Criteo and The Trade Desk meet a set of proven criteria. Good adtech companies derive their competitive advantage from three main areas: They own or enable unique supply, have unique data or own the advertiser relationships as a tech provider versus a service provider. Owning and enabling supply means having unique and/or enabling access to advertising inventory connected with the valuable audiences advertisers need to reach. Having unique data means providing the insight and intelligence to help advertisers target and optimize messages to those consumers. And having the advertiser relationships as a tech provider means providing the software and technology tools that advertisers need to create and deploy campaigns to those consumers. In contrast, a \\u201cbadtech\\u201d company relies on arbitrage and, in effect, rents traffic rather than owning it. Many adtech companies buy their supply by making revenue commitments and guarantees to publishers, effectively making their reach a liability rather than an asset. The tech is primarily a new ad execution that can easily be replicated. Other instances of badtech take the form of new ad units designed to maximize short-term performance stats, gaming the measurement standards that still reward clicks and views instead of real engagement. Often these badtech tactics compromise the user experience and lead to ad blocking. The badtech might generate some impressive numbers, but really what it\\u2019s doing is prioritizing short-term gains at the expense of the long-term relationship between brands, publishers and consumers. It may be a stretch to claim that our category will pull out a Facebook, but the lesson is clear: As many investors ran, the good investors and entrepreneurs kept innovating and reaped the huge benefits. Adtech is a massive category, and those paying attention know that change and innovation is happening in the space more so than ever. That innovation is creating real value and is separating the winners from the also-rans. The big crunch that is coming will leave the shining stars intact and help them shine even brighter.

       "  u'After days of speculation, the deal is now official : AT&T is acquiring Time Warner for $85\\xa0billion in a mix of cash and shares, paving the way for another behemoth in the converged media horizon. The final acquisition price will be $107.50 per share, paid\\xa0in half cash and half AT&T stock. This means that for each outstanding share of Time Warner stock investors will receive $53.75 in cash and $53.75 in AT&T stock. This price gives Time Warner a valuation of $85.4 billion \\u2013 after the deal is finalized Time Warner shareholders will own between 14.4% and 15.7% of all outstanding AT&T shares.\\xa0Time Warner will represent about 15% of the combined company\\u2019s revenues after the deal closes. AT&T will be financing the cash portion of the transaction \\u2013 about $42.7 billion, with new debt as well as cash already on the company\\u2019s balance sheet. In terms of combined shareholder benefits, AT&T said the deal should result in $1 billion worth of annual cost synergies within 3 years of the deal closing. In a way, this deal harkens back to a very\\xa0old trope in the tech/media/telecoms world: carriers have long worried about becoming dumb pipes and to counteract that need\\xa0to develop interesting convergence plays. That\\u2019s in essence what AT&T is getting here. The deal will bring the carrier a huge trove of content producing properties, including HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. studio that will give it a leg up in its own video and content business. Specifically, the deal will give AT&T a new channel for accessing and using content from the properties it now owns on the services that it sells to consumers. Owning the content means not only better access, but better margins to tap into that content. There seems to be some kind of poetic symmetry in AT&T buying Time Warner. Its big carrier rival, Verizon, acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in June, 2015. AOL and Time Warner, long ago, combined to form a single company, in what is considered by many to be the worst merger in corporate history (which unsuprisingly eventually split). Just as Verizon has been snapping up companies to consolidate its position (it\\u2019s in the process of buying Yahoo, and it has also put billions into other businesses in other areas like IoT), AT&T has been acquiring more video service providers \\u2014 including DirecTV and Charter Communications \\u2014 to expand its footprint in the content delivery business. Now it\\u2019s filling out the first part of that moniker: the content. Senator Al Franken issed a statement on the deal, noting how it may end up being bad for consumers: Both companies will be holding a joint call at 8:30am ET on Monday morning to discuss the transaction.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/myheritage-launches-dna-testing-service-to-help-you-uncover-your-familys-history/',\n",
       "  u'The popular online genealogy service MyHeritage today announced the launch of its MyHeritage DNA service for helping its users uncover more about their family\\u2019s history and ethnicity. Users who take the test, which currently costs $79 (plus shipping), will get a detailed ethnicity report that will map their families\\u2019 ethnic and geographic origins and, if available, the report will also show potential DNA matches for finding relatives on the service as well. As MyHeritage CEO and founder Gilad Japhet told me, he believes that DNA testing is the future of family history. The test itself, he said, is based on a simple cheek scrape test that shouldn\\u2019t take more than a minute or two. Getting results takes a bit longer, though. The company\\u2019s U.S.-based lab takes about three to four weeks to return results to the users. For now, the company\\u2019s reports include 25 ethnicities, but the plan is to quickly grow this number to more than 100 ethnicities (and as MyHeritage gathers more data, it will also update older DNA reports with this new and more detailed information). To seed its DNA database, MyHeritage is running what it calls the \\u201cFounder Population project.\\u201d As part of this, it has sent out 5,000 free DNA kits to existing members around the world. With its massive database of 2.1 billion profiles from 85 million registered users and 7 billion historical records, MyHeritage already has a lot of the data\\xa0that will allow it to make this new DNA information even more valuable. Thanks to this mix of data, Japhet hopes that these tests will soon not just be able to tell you that you are heritage is part Greek and part Italian, but also what exact island in Greece your family may have lived on in the past. \\u201cDo you enjoy cold nights and snowy days and nobody understood why?,\\u201d Japhet said. \\u201cWe found you have 15% Finnish roots \\u2014\\xa0maybe that explains it! People always want to learn more about themselves and DNA is awesome for that.\\u201d MyHeritage\\xa0expects that its DNA study will be able to provide a higher resolution than its competitors\\u2019 tests (think Ancestry and 23andMe ), but for users who have already taken a competing test, the company will allow them to import their data into MyHeritage\\u2019s database and get a free report. As Japhet stressed, MyHeritage sees itself as a tech company. MyHeritage has raised a combined $49 million in venture capital\\xa0so far and Japhet tells me that the company is currently seeing revenues in the range of $50 to $100 million per year. As Japhet told me, the company is able to offer its DNA kit at a lower price than its competitors because it expects to be able to convert some customers to paying MyHeritage users over time \\u2014 and with a database of millions of existing users, it already has a massive number of potential customers for its DNA tests, too, so\\xa0it won\\u2019t need to invest into a lot of marketing either. \\u201cDNA is attractive to our current users who want to learn more about their family history,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s also appealing to a whole new demographic: younger people who are curious about what they can learn from their DNA. It gives them effortless answers about their ethnicity and family history. We think it will attract new customers to family history in large numbers. The synergy between DNA and our existing business is substantial giving us upsell capabilities and an edge over many competitors.\\u201d ',\n",

       "  u'Gmail users on iOS \\u2013 if you haven\\u2019t downloaded it yet, there\\u2019s likely a new version of Gmail waiting in your queue. Google\\u2019s near ubiquitous electronic mail application is getting some key upgrades for version 5.0.3 , including, notably, a revamped UI that makes it look just like the native Android version of the app. Along with a more defined color scheme and more well pronounced icons, the new look (for iOS, at least) brings with it some subtle but important chances to the experience that should speed things up over all, bringing performance a lot closer to its Android counterpart. Among the changes are better transitions and intuitive features like the ability to swipe on a message to archive or delete it, depending on which you opt for in the app\\u2019s own settings page. Search has been sped up, too, populating faster and giving you quicker suggestions when you spell something wrong.

       "  u'It looks like the last picture show for one of Google\\u2019s efforts at expanding into more detailed vertical search pages. Without much notice, the\\xa0search giant has closed down\\xa0its standalone movie site where people were\\xa0able to search for cinemas, films and show times on a particular date and near a specific\\xa0location, rolling\\xa0some of the functionality directly into its main search portal.\\xa0\\u201cGoogle Showtimes\\u201d, as the service was called, now brings up a 404 error if you try to visit its main page. The \\u201cabout\\u201d description, however, linked above, provides the following message: A spokesperson declined to comment further\\xa0about the closure and whether it was part of one of Google\\u2019s recurring spring cleaning (or autumn cleaning, as the case may be) service closures. It\\u2019s not clear why Google decided to shut the separate portal but there are some signs that Google Showtimes what not much of a blockbuster for the company, and perhaps\\xa0even ran counter to how Google sees some of its bigger developments in search and media. Google\\u2019s movie portal\\xa0looks like it first went live in some form in the autumn of 2005 , and as you can see from a screenshot from October 2016 below, it never updated much beyond its\\xa0interface based around Google\\u2019s original,\\xa0very simple, pared-down aesthetics in its original search experience. This was actually a good thing, it seems, as groups of (now former) users on Google\\u2019s product forums , Reddit , and elsewhere who are complaining about the closure note the contrast with competing services from the likes of Fandango and Movietickets \\u2014 which, may look more snappy but are less useful for finding cinemas and films\\xa0based on specific locations and times that might not be exactly where you are at that precise moment. Those users now appear\\xa0ready to throw their popcorn at Google for retiring Google Showtimes and funneling some of the features into Google.com, which presents basic\\xa0results like this when I search for a theater or film here in the UK at Google.com: It looks like Google didn\\u2019t do much in the way of selling ads against Showtimes, meaning that the traffic that was resulting from it, such as it was, didn\\u2019t necessarily convert to revenue for the company. Google Showtimes\\xa0somewhat went against bigger trends in the film industry, which is bracing itself for another tough year where cinemas are concerned. Box office ticket sales for 2016 are on track to be the worst in a century, according to Vanity Fair . Google Showtimes also stood separate from the wider industry trend for streaming and Google\\u2019s own\\xa0ambitions to become a platform for distributing and consuming video, coming as it did a full year before the acquisition of YouTube (and many years before services\\xa0like Android TV ). Instead, Google Showtimes appeared to germinate\\xa0more from\\xa0the company\\u2019s strategy to expand into more vertical search categories, providing landing places for people who are going to the web to look for specific information and choosing specific portals to get there, rather than Google\\u2019s catch-all Google.com, a trend that has grown with the rise of smartphone use, where people want fewer steps between looking for something and arriving at an answer. That effort has resulted in the building of an extensive mapping product, Google Maps , but also portals like Google Flights for plane ticket searches and Google Finance for financial news and data. It may be that while Google is still working on new search experiences beyond Google.com, they are more likely to be based around other vertical definitions (like mobile, location, and so on) than Google might have originally conceived. Indeed, Google Showtimes is not the first vertical portal that Google has shut down. Google\\u2019s hotel finder now lives within another maps rather than as a separate site.',\n",

       "  u'Tesla\\u2019s network of Superchargers have so far offered free, unlimited use to drivers of Tesla vehicles, but that was never going to last forever. Tesla announced upcoming changes to the Supercharger program today, which will introduce a fee for owners who purchase their vehicle after January 1, 2017 \\u2013 but only if they exceed 400 kWh of charging in a year, which translates to roughly 1,000 miles of driving. Once that threshold is passed, Tesla owners will begin being charged an incremental fee depending on usage, but one that will still undershoot the price of filling up a fuel-based car\\u2019s gas tank. As mentioned, orders until January 1, 2017 and existing owners and orders aren\\u2019t affected \\u2013\\xa0they still get free Supercharging for the life of their vehicle, provided they take delivery before April 1, 2017. Tesla says the change is about adjusting the economics of Supercharging in a way that \\u201callows us to reinvest in the network, accelerate its growth,\\u201d but also notes that while they will begin charging customers after a certain point, the \\u201cSupercharger Network will never be a profit center,\\u201d which implies all funds generated will go to maintenance and expansion/improvement of the resource for drivers. The timelines for the changes to come into effect mean that any Model 3 owners will have the capped Supercharging plan, and Tesla isn\\u2019t yet revealing the specifics of its usage-based pricing. That effective 1,000 mile cap means that the needs of many, many drivers will be met before they hit that Supercharge limit, however, since this really only impacts those using their cars for trips outside the car\\u2019s considerable range when they don\\u2019t have time or inclination to stop and charge at a normal rate. Tesla also says it\\u2019ll release further details of how the pricing for charging beyond 400 kWh will work later this year, but also notes that these details may vary over time and by region, depending on the price of electricity and other factors. We always new the unlimited free Supercharger program couldn\\u2019t last forever. At least legacy Tesla owners will at least be able to find some comfort over not getting hardware needed for self-driving in their cars with the knowledge that they can at least use Superchargers indefinitely.',\n",

From there, you\\u2019ll choose the option \\u201cSelect as GIF\\u201d when selecting the Live Photo from your Photo and Video Library. While you can send GIFs (and Live Photos or videos) from your phone, WhatsApp also includes an integrated GIF search engine, powered by Tenor or Giphy. (We\\u2019ve asked the company to clarify how it\\u2019s choosing which engine to display as the default to which users, but it didn\\u2019t yet respond.) You can search through the available GIFs to find those you want to share, and\\xa0mark select items\\xa0as Favorites to be used again in the future. In addition, you can edit your GIFs after selecting them, by trimming the clip, rotating it, by adding emoji or colorful text, ahead of hitting \\u201cSend.\\u201d All of these\\xa0changes have not yet rolled out to the Android version of the app, which could be why WhatsApp hasn\\u2019t yet made an official announcement about the update. The features were also available during beta tests. During the testing period, WhatsApp switched the default GIF search engine from Giphy to Tenor at one point. However, Giphy asserts it\\u2019s still involved. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been working with WhatsApp since they started exploring integrating GIFs,\\u201d notes Giphy\\u2019s Director of Biz Dev, David Rosenberg, adding that it\\u2019s fairly standard for apps like this to leverage multiple providers. The change comes at a time when Facebook has been increasingly focused on competing more directly with rival Snapchat through a number of features across its platforms, including Facebook itself, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. More recently, the company was\\xa0spotted\\xa0testing a clone of Snapchat\\u2019s Stories feature on WhatsApp, called \\u201cStatus .\\u201d This offered a similar editing interface, as it allowed users to snap photos or videos then using an in-app editor to add other content, including their own scribbles, text and emoji.',\n",

       "  u' In late October, the Federal Communications Commission passed new rules that take the unprecedented step of imposing stricter privacy regulation on one specific set of actors in the Internet ecosystem. Along party lines, the FCC voted to impose onerous limitations on Internet service providers\\u2019 use of web browsing information without regard to whether the information is sensitive or not, which differs greatly from the guidelines governing all other online companies, like search engines and mobile apps. Not only are these rules based on an inaccurate understanding of the underlying technology, they also create a fragmented privacy framework that deviates from the approach established by the Federal Trade Commission that has proven so effective in supporting innovation. The Internet was relatively simple when it first exploded into the public\\u2019s consciousness during the mid-1990s. The typical user relied on a personal computer connected to their home telephone line to send an\\xa0email or browse the World Wide Web. A wide range of technologies and companies emerged that rely on personal data to provide a dazzling new array of free (or, more properly, advertising-supported) services. To best protect consumers, the Federal Trade Commission created a privacy regime that provides the greatest protection for the most sensitive data, such as health care and financial information, while adopting a more permissive approach to less sensitive data, such as the use of purchase histories to make product recommendations. The modern Internet has become far more complex and decentralized. A much larger number of users are employing a far broader range of devices and network technologies to run a greater variety of applications. A decade or two ago, networks were able to learn about end users since they typically accessed the Internet from a fixed location, such as their homes. Today users access the Internet from everywhere via mobile devices, which scatters information about individuals\\u2019 usage across a wide range of network providers and locations. Simultaneously, the increasing use of encryption is limiting networks\\u2019 ability to view the content of the traffic they are carrying. In addition, modern operating systems and applications require that users identify themselves prior to using them. This practice permits operating systems and applications to track users across devices and locations, whether inside or outside the home and to use personal information in ways that many users do not anticipate. Even browsing the web is now fundamentally different. For example, HTML version 5 added an API for geolocation. Web pages are now also designed to observe when a user using a mouse is hovering over particular content without clicking on it. In the world of advertising-supported services, information gathered about users can make advertising better targeted and more effective. But at the same time, consumers who enjoy access to Internet services are concerned about protecting their privacy. As a result, the best way to give consumers what they want is to strike an appropriate balance between which uses of personal information to permit and which ones to restrict. The FCC\\u2019s approach abandons this nuanced perspective in favor of an approach that prohibits practices on which online companies frequently rely, such as making product recommendations based on past browsing and purchase history. As a result, the best way to give consumers what they want is to strike an appropriate balance between which uses of personal information to permit and which ones to restrict. The FCC\\u2019s approach abandons this nuanced perspective in favor of an approach that prohibits practices on which online companies frequently rely, such as making product recommendations based on past browsing and purchase history. The speed of technological change counsels against regulating the Internet based on any particular conception of the current state of technology, as the inevitable evolution will soon render any understanding obsolete. Instead, privacy regulation should embrace the well-accepted principle of technological neutrality, a principle that the FTC\\u2019s privacy framework has embraced and that the Obama Administration fully endorsed in its 2012 Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. But sadly, the FCC\\u2019s rules abandon this approach by subjecting network providers to greater restrictions than content and application providers. The FCC would have better served consumers if it had followed the balanced, context-sensitive approach to privacy that has proven so effective in supporting the creation of a steady stream of new and innovative services. Although there is always more that could and should be done to ensure that end users know what happens to their personal information, any solutions need to embrace the entire industry and to calibrate the level of privacy protection based on the sensitivity of the data. Subjecting some parts of the Internet ecosystem to heavier burdens will inevitably lead innovators to design their systems to avoid regulatory burdens instead of focusing on the best technical way to deliver what consumers want. And it will create serious risks that the regulations of today could foreclose the innovations of tomorrow from ever appearing. That is why the FTC filed comments calling for the application of consistent rules to all parts of the Internet, but, unfortunately, the FCC did not fully heed those calls. The approach taken by the FCC will lead to a world in which technological progress is dictated by the actions of regulators based on an incomplete and static technological snapshot that will become outdated in a flash instead of by innovators experimenting with ways to provide users with groundbreaking new services.',\n",

       "  u'Blippar , the company that has brought a full augmented reality experience to a smartphone near you, has today announced the launch of its self-service suite of tools. This is the first time that Blippar has made its technology publicly available to developers, letting them tap into Blippar\\u2019s Computer Vision API and attach their own augmented reality experiences to real-world objects. When Blippar first launched, the company offered a way for brands and publishers to give a deeper dive on their product or advertisement. They did this through a Blipp, a real-world sticker that helped the Blippar app recognize the product and ultimately show more information through AR. Eventually, the company decided to go beyond mere AR advertising to create an AR search engine. There are things in this world that are nearly impossible to search for, like a specific type of flower or the brand of shoes you just saw on the street. But in June, the company launched its visual search engine to help users identify those highly visual objects that they couldn\\u2019t put their finger on. With today\\u2019s launch, it\\u2019s not just the users who get increased access to the world of AR, but developers, as well. The BlippBuilder Augmented Reality Suite comes with both drag-and-drop options for marketers and designers (who don\\u2019t have coding experience) as well as a JavaScript option for developers who wish to write out their own code. Plus, the Suite includes Blippar\\u2019s Computer Vision API so that developers can attach an AR experience to any real-world object for their own users. \\u201cDemocratizing augmented reality across the industry starts with understanding actual reality,\\u201d said Mitra. \\u201cWe wanted a full suite of tools, including our computer vision API, before we opened up public access so that developers and marketers would only be held back by the limits of their own imagination.\\u201d You can get started with BlippBuilder for free as an individual developer, with a per-license cost for enterprise users.

It\\u2019s taken a while, but the company today launched an update to the Android Auto app for \\u2014 well \\u2014 Android that makes good on this promise. Even if your car isn\\u2019t Android Auto compatible, you can now\\xa0get all the benefits of Android Auto without the cost of a new mid-size sedan. So what\\u2019s the point of that? Android Auto on the phone provides you with a simplified interface that combines\\xa0directions, music, and incoming messages into a relatively distraction free experience. That\\u2019s essentially the same interface you would see on an in-car display with Android Auto support. Android Auto works with popular apps like Spotify, Pandora, Google Maps and others. Like all things Google, the app\\xa0will also soon let you use \\u201cOk Google\\u201d commands to use directions, send messages and control your music. One smart thing Google has done here is given users the ability to automatically start the app when the phone is paired with your car\\u2019s Bluetooth network. The Android Auto app is compatible with any phone that runs Android 5.0 and newer. Google says the update will roll out to users in more than 30 countries over the course of the next few days, so if you don\\u2019t see it yet, don\\u2019t despair and buy an Audi A6 just so you don\\u2019t feel left out.',\n",

       "  u'Video quality on YouTube is getting an upgrade today, with the launch of HDR support across the video-sharing site. HDR offers improved picture quality with higher contrast, which means you\\u2019ll see more vibrant colors as well as make out more of the image in darker, shadowy scenes. However, not many consumers will be immediately available to enjoy the new HDR videos, as the technology is still rolling out to the mass market. Instead, this launch is about YouTube getting its site ready for that future. However,\\xa0if you happen to own an HDR-enabled TV today, you can view HDR content on select YouTube channels going live with the enhanced content, like MysteryGuitarMan , Jacob + Katie Schwarz , and Abandon Visuals , says Google. (There\\u2019s also a launch playlist available here .)

For creators who want to get ahead of the curve, however, YouTube is making HDR video upload a new option on its service as of Monday. The company notes it worked with\\xa0the DaVinci Resolve team to make HDR video upload as simple as SDR video upload.

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/parallel-pr-universe/',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cWould you mind having an off-the-record conversation about your questions? Is that Ok?\\u201d said the PR rep at a leading publicly listed technology company. \\u201cErr\\u2026 sure,\\u201d I replied, more than a little puzzled. The questions\\u200a \\u2014 \\u200awhich I put to Intel, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Slack, Google, and Salesforce\\u200a \\u2014 were pretty straightforward. I simply wanted to know why none of the major technology companies in the U.S. (with the exception of LinkedIn) include disability in their public diversity reporting, and if they had plans to do so. \\u201cGreat,\\u201d continued the PR. \\u201cLet me tell you what I\\u2019ve found out\\u2026\\u201d. What came next, of course, I can\\u2019t quote\\xa0or attribute to anybody at the company. Outside of a parallel public relations universe, this conversation never actually took place. I approached the next name on my list and a pattern began to emerge. \\u201c[Still] to be decided on what I\\u2019ll be able to share on the record, but I can definitely give you some information on background,\\u201d came a now-familiar reply. Others wanted to know who else I had asked, perhaps for fear of saying too much or making an unnecessary first move. \\u201cWhen is your deadline?\\u201d was also a stock response, before, in a number of\\xa0instances, the trail went dead. It seems that many\\xa0leading U.S. technology companies don\\u2019t want to talk about disability and employee diversity \\u2014 at least not publicly. According to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2015 only 17.5 percent of persons with a disability (PWDs) were employed and this compares to 65 percent for those without a disability. The Bureau also says that although the official unemployment rate for PWDs (counted as persons who do not have a job, are available for work, and are actively looking for a job) fell to 10.7 percent in 2015, it was still twice that of those without a disability, which stood at 5.1 percent. Now, as someone with quite a severe disability , I would be the first to acknowledge that there are myriad\\xa0reasons why a PWD could find it difficult to secure employment or to work at all, and that employers aren\\u2019t always\\xa0to blame. Agism could also be a factor, since disability disproportionately affects older people. And so could educational attainment; by some measurements, PWDs are less likely to be degree educated than those without. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is very clear: across all age groups and all levels of education, PWDs were much less likely to be employed than were their counterparts with no disability. That said, there\\xa0are also many practical things employers can do to help PWDs overcome challenges at work, and in turn benefit from a workforce truly made up of all the talents . At its best,\\xa0technology acts as an enabler for PWDs, helping to level the playing field, and\\xa0therefore can be a genuine\\xa0force for social mobility. However, since disability isn\\u2019t included in most technology companies\\u2019 public diversity reporting, what we don\\u2019t know is how well the technology industry itself is doing with regards to the number of PWDs it\\xa0employs and how this compares company to company. The reason why an increasing number of technology companies publish diversity reports regards gender, race and ethnicity\\u2014 and why it\\u2019s important that they do so\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ais it sends a signal to other prospective employees that a\\xa0workplace is inclusive and that diversity matters. Crucially, it also enables publications like this one to hold those companies to account. Without the data to back it up we can\\u2019t say for sure if a company is becoming more diverse, regardless of what efforts they say they are taking or how much PR they generate. Here are the specific questions I put to Intel, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Slack, Google and Salesforce: The first to reply and most open was Slack. \\u201cEarly thought is that Slack will include that information in our diversity reporting, as we are legally able to capture it, and employees are willing to share it,\\u201d said a spokesperson. The point here is that, if I understand correctly, you can\\u2019t legally force employees to declare if they have a disability to prevent against discrimination. Any reporting has to be non-mandatory and self-identified. The company was also willing to talk about efforts being made within the organisation and Slack\\u2019s inclusive culture. However, since it doesn\\u2019t currently track \\u201cdisability status\\u201d it couldn\\u2019t provide data on how many PWDs the company employs. Apple doesn\\u2019t currently include PWD employment data in its public diversity reporting. At first the company pointed me to its accessibility efforts with regards to its own products\\u200a, something it also highlighted in a video shown at the recent new MacBook Pro launch. I understand that Apple believes making its products accessible is the best way to signal that the company\\xa0welcomes employees with disabilities. However, I\\u2019m unconvinced\\xa0you can spin the lack of PWD diversity reporting (and therefore accountability) into a discussion about product design. After I told Apple\\xa0that all of the other major technology companies approached were going on record (which turned out not to be true), the company offered the following statement: Twitter does not include PWDs in its reporting but declined to go on record. However, I understand the company follows the EEO-1 report guidelines (required by the U.S. government), which doesn\\u2019t include PWDs. It also has processes for applicants, future employees and current employees to request accommodations related to their disabilities, and Twitter engages to reasonably accommodate these requests. Like Apple, the company pointed me to its accessibility  efforts from a product perspective, and I understand that Twitter sees inclusion as a leading principle of the company. Intel were surprisingly forthcoming. A spokesperson for the company told me it does not currently include data on employees with disabilities in its annual and mid-year diversity and inclusion reports, but \\u201cas the reports evolve\\u201d this could change. They were also keen to highlight the diversity work Intel is currently doing, some of which directly relates to working with PWDs: Since the statement was provided, Intel announced it has expanded its diversity fund to include support for PWDs. That\\u2019s progress. All three companies responded on the 18th of October to my original request, with Facebook and Salesforce asking when my deadline was. Despite following up again 7 days later, I\\u2019ve still yet to hear back from either company. Meanwhile, the correct spokesperson for Google still could not be reached at\\xa0the time of publication. One of the off-the-record arguments put forward to not include\\xa0PWDs in diversity reporting is that the resulting\\xa0data would be inaccurate. Since not all employees with a disability would feel comfortable declaring that they have one, and not every disability is\\xa0visible, the process would be prone to under-reporting. However, it is hard to see how technology companies\\xa0can have it both ways:\\xa0talking up an\\xa0inclusive and supportive workplace culture whilst at the same time\\xa0claiming\\xa0that PWDs would be too afraid to identify as such. Either way, if the technology industry is serious about employee diversity with regards to PWDs, then it needs to find a way to be accountable. You can\\u2019t solve the PWD diversity reporting\\xa0problem until you admit that you have one.\\xa0The first step is to begin talking about it.',\n",

       "  u'Google has been highly involved with connecting U.S. voters to timely information throughout this election cycle, by offering everything from voter registration assistance to polling place information in its search result pages. Today, the company announced plans to\\xa0display the results of the U.S. election directly in search, in over 30 languages, as soon as the polls close. Web searchers who query for \\u201celection results\\u201d will be able to view detailed information on the\\xa0Presidential, Senatorial, Congressional, Gubernatorial races as well as state-level referenda and ballot propositions, says Google. The results will be updated continuously\\xa0\\u2013 every 30 seconds, as indicated by a screenshot shared by the company on its official blog post detailing the new features. Tabs across the top will let you switch to between the various races, like President, House, and Senate, for example. The results will also include information like how many more electoral votes a presidential candidate needs to win, how many seats are up for grabs in the House and Senate, and how many Gubernatorial races are underway, among other things. This data is presented in an easy-to-read format, with Democrats in blue, Republicans in red, and simple graphs, alongside the key numbers. While Google has offered voter assistance tools for years in past elections, the company has really stepped up its game in this most recent cycle, with the rollout of web and mobile tools that helped people figure out how to register , how to vote or vote early, where to find their polls, who\\u2019s on the ballot , and more. It also made\\xa0those guides available in\\xa0Spanish . And Google heavily pushed voters to get involved with home page ads on its usually sparse Google.com site. In addition, it\\u2019s today running a banner at the top of Gmail that offers to show you where to vote \\u2013 something it hasn\\u2019t done in years past. The Google Doodle is also being used to remind people of\\xa0the election . The increased efforts come at a time when more people are turning to the web to get information about the elections. The company\\xa0says it has seen a 233 percent increase in search traffic for the phrase \\u201chow to vote\\u201d compared with the 2012 elections, for example. The election results will be made available as soon as the polls close on Election Day, says Google. The company also notes it will be live streaming election news on YouTube via the channels offered by NBC , PBS , MTV , Bloomberg , Telemundo , The Young Turks , and others. Already, viewers spent over 20 million hours watching and rewatching the debate live streams on the site, the company added. ',\n",

For users of Android who had\\xa0a custom ROM rather than the Google Play version of the OS, the fork of Signal offered an easy-to-use \\u201cGoogle-free\\u201d alternative \\u2014 something of value to those concerned about surveillance by an ad targeting giant, not just state surveillance activity.\\xa0However\\xa0after Marlinspike told the developers of LibreSignal to stop using Signal\\u2019s name and\\xa0servers, back in\\xa0May, they abandoned the project . He\\xa0had complained it was complex and expensive for OWS to accommodate\\xa0LibreSignal on its servers. On this, Venema writes: \\u201cUnfortunately, the policy decisions of OpenWhisperSystems and Moxie Marlinspike make it so that it became impossible to reliably run unofficial Signal clients that use the same server infrastructure, so people can communicate.\\u201d He also says the blog post as triggered by seeing\\xa0Signal spending resources adding support for GIF search , rather than more serious features. Marlinspike\\u2019s rebuttal of Venema\\u2019s criticism\\xa0is to point out he has called\\xa0for the community to make a pull request\\xa0for Websocket-only support in Signal multiple times, and no one has so far stepped up: He also emphasizes\\xa0that\\xa0no data is transmitted over GCM. (Although it\\u2019s not clear whether some\\xa0usage metadata might not\\xa0be transmitted to Google via this route.) \\u201cGCM is only used as a push event to tell the Signal Android client to wake up and connect to the Signal server to retrieve messages from the queue if the app isn\\u2019t in the foreground,\\u201d he writes. Venema also speculates that\\xa0Google could be strong-armed by intelligence agencies to\\xa0serve a \\u201cspecially modified update or version of Signal to specific targets for surveillance\\u201d \\u2014 arguing it\\u2019s therefore \\u201cstrongly preferable to run a secure messaging client on a more secure platform\\u201d. \\u201cCurrently when it comes to Signal this cannot be done in any official way, and it would help for the people who really need secure messaging services (instead of the people who merely use it as a replacement of say WhatsApp), if the software runs on other Android distributions, like Copperhead,\\u201d he argues. There is a way to\\xa0use Signal without depending on GCM \\u2014 by using microg \\u2014 but Venema says\\xa0this is way too complex for non-technical users, given it can\\xa0require\\xa0a user to\\xa0re-compile their kernel. Whereas LibreSignal\\u2019s approach\\xa0had, in his view, lowered the barrier to entry. Yet that\\xa0project withered on the vine after\\xa0OWS withdrew support. He\\xa0also calls out OWS for what he describes as \\u201cexpressly\\u201d hindering and prohibiting federation \\u2014 meaning LibreSignal cannot\\xa0run their own servers and then federate within the wider Signal network.\\xa0\\u201cI don\\u2019t see the point of doing any of this secure messaging stuff, without having federation. The internet was built on federation,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t federate, if we don\\u2019t cooperate, what is there to stop the internet from becoming a bunch of proprietary walled gardens again? Is the internet then really nothing more than just a platform for us to use certain proprietary silo services on? Signal then, just happens to be a (partly proprietary) silo on which your messages are transmitted securely.\\u201d Responding to this criticism,\\xa0Marlinspike claims the Signal clients and server do already support federation. Although this is clearly a technical possibility, rather than something Signal has set out to actively support and encourage. On the contrary, Marlinspike\\xa0has argued it\\xa0is no\\xa0longer\\xa0possible to build a competitive federated messenger \\u2014 which is\\xa0why\\xa0OWS built Signal as an unfederated service. His previously stated view is that federation freezes development and is\\xa0just not appropriate for a\\xa0fast-moving app ecosystem \\u2014 pointing to WhatsApp being able to introduce\\xa0end to end encryption across its entire user base \\u201cwith a single software update\\u201d as an example of\\xa0the\\xa0advantage of\\xa0centralization vs federation. \\u201cOnce you federate your protocol, it becomes very difficult to make changes. And right now, at the application level, things that stand still don\\u2019t fare very well in a world where the ecosystem is moving,\\u201d he wrote back in May (when he also said OWS would be \\u201cunlikely to ever federate with clients and servers we don\\u2019t control\\u201d). \\u201cNothing about any of the protocols we\\u2019ve developed requires centralization; it\\u2019s entirely possible to build a federated Signal Protocol based messenger, but I no longer believe that it is possible to build a competitive federated messenger at all,\\u201d he added at the time. Yesterday Marlinspike appeared to\\xa0soften\\xa0his\\xa0view slightly, by saying:\\xa0\\u201cI would love it if someone proved me wrong\\u201d, as well as\\xa0offering help for others\\xa0to start a federated network using the protocol. \\u201cThere shouldn\\u2019t be any technical hurdles stopping the people who are really into federation from using our software to start their own federated network that demonstrates the viability of their ideas\\u201d, he writes. Although he also reiterates his preference\\xa0for\\xa0running Signal as a centralized service by arguing it has other potential advantages \\u2014 such as for developing new protocols to bolster\\xa0metadata protection. \\u201cThe nice thing about having a centralized service is that we can eventually take steps in this direction,\\u201d he says. \\u201cPeople seem to equate federation with meta-data hiding for reasons I\\u2019ve never totally understood, but I think serious metadata protection is going to require new protocols and new techniques, so we\\u2019re much more likely to see major progress in centralized rather than distributed environments (in the same way that Signal Protocol is now on over two billion devices, but we\\u2019re unlikely to ever see even basic large scale email end to end encryption).\\u201d Another of\\xa0Venema\\u2019s criticisms is that Signal associates\\xa0phone numbers with names \\u2014 meaning a user\\u2019s contacts\\u2019 list is not private. He argues that using usernames to connect users would\\xa0be a superior approach from a privacy point of view, as well as also helping support federation. On this, Marlinspike notes that on Android 6+ users of Signal have the ability to disable contacts permissions without the app not working. But he goes on to concede that metadata in general\\xa0is an area where OWS would \\u201clike to do even better\\u201d (such as by developing the aforementioned new protocol). Early last month OWS revealed it had received its first subpoena for user data, although it claimed\\xa0the only data it can produce in response to such a\\xa0request is the date and time a user registered with Signal, and the last date of a user\\u2019s connectivity to the Signal service. And\\xa0Marlinspike\\u2019s verdict is that things are \\u201cplaying out alright\\u201d in terms of how much user data can be strong-armed from the service at this point, even without a better fix for metadata. Venema is also critical of OWS for not open sourcing the phone component of Signal (aka\\xa0RedPhone). Which\\xa0means people forking the protocol are prevented from running their own phone servers \\u2014 and likely explains why secure encrypted calls don\\u2019t work in alternative apps\\xa0such as LibreSignal. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know exactly what prevents the RedPhone server code from being released (whether it is legal issues or simple unwillingness), but I do think it is strange that there is no movement whatsoever to move to a different/alternative solution, that respects users\\u2019 rights,\\u201d he writes. Marlinspike makes no direct comment on this critique \\u2014 beyond his general rebuttal of OWS\\xa0having limited development resources.\\xa0We\\u2019ve reached out to him\\xa0directly with questions on the RedPhone open sourcing point and will update this post with any response. Like Marlinspike,\\xa0Venema also ultimately calls for a\\xa0wider\\xa0pro-privacy community to address the concerns\\xa0he\\u2019s raising and work together to build more secure services. \\u201cWe as a community need to come up with a viable solution and alternative to Signal that is easy to use and that does in fact respect people\\u2019s choices, both in the hardware and software that they choose to run,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cWe need to cooperate more as a community instead of creating these little islands, otherwise we are not going to succeed in defeating or even meaningfully defending against Big Brother. \\u201cRemember, our enemy knows how to divide and conquer. Divide et impere. It\\u2019s been a basic government subjugation tactic since the Roman times. We should not allow our own petty egos and quest for eternal hacker fame to get in the way of our actual goal: dismantling the surveillance states globally.\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/googles-firebase-developer-platform-gets-better-analytics-crash-reports-and-more/',\n",
       "  u'Google today launched the first major update to its Firebase backend-as-a-service platform since it first announced its plans to turn the service into its unified platform for developers six months ago. While Facebook decided to shut down its competing Parse service earlier this year, Google decided to double down on Firebase (which it acquired in 2014 ) as its flagship development platform for app developers on iOS and Android, as well as web developers. Today\\u2019s update includes the 1.0 launch of Firebase\\u2019s crash reporting tool, improved real-time analytics that are now also integrated into\\xa0Google\\u2019s\\xa0BigQuery database service, better support for game developers who use Unity, and the launch of a new Firebase Udacity course for iOS and Android developers. As Ben Galbraith, who leads product and developer relations in Google\\u2019s Developer Products Group, told me,\\xa0building\\xa0apps today is far more complex than it\\xa0was two or three years ago. When \\u201cmobile-first\\u201d became a thing, you only had to consider a few screen sizes and platform. Today, your users may be on hundreds of different devices. In addition to this platform challenge, though, you also have to consider all of the infrastructure work that goes into running a modern app, be that authentication, real-time data syncing, A/B testing or crash analytics. \\u201cWhether you are on iOS or Android, there is this set of concerns that you have to think about \\u2014 but they are all table stakes,\\u201d Galbraith said. \\u201cWe want to take those off the table for you so you can focus on something new and innovative for your users.\\u201d At the core of Firebase is its analytics service, which is available for free \\u2014 just like Google Analytics\\xa0is available for free, (you can almost think of it as\\xa0the loss leader in the Firebase feature set).\\xa0For the most part, Firebase Analytics is not a real-time service and as Galbraith noted,\\xa0for most use cases, that\\u2019s not a problem. Sometimes, however, you do want to get real-time feedback from your apps \\u2014 especially when you are testing them and want to make sure that your analytics setup is working. For those use cases, Firebase Analytics now offers a new real-time debug view (in beta). In addition, Firebase now lets its users export data to BigQuery, Google\\u2019s big data analytics warehouse, in real time, too. This allows developers to dig deeper into their data than the basic Firebase Analytics service currently allows. Using BigQuery can quickly become expensive, but the company now offers a free tier, too. By combining the data in BigQuery with Google\\u2019s Data Studio visualization service, developers can easily build their own real-time dashboards for Firebase Analytics. Firebase Analytics now also uploads any conversion events in real time,\\xa0so developers will be able\\xa0to\\xa0set up systems to quickly react to these incoming events, too. Another major feature of Firebase is its Crash Reporting service. This feature, too, is now becoming a bit more real time. Previously, it took about 20 minutes before all the data for a crash was available in the Firebase dashboard. Now, that time is down to one minute. More importantly, though, this crash data now includes more data about the context of each crash by combining the crash data with Firebase\\u2019s\\xa0analytics data to show you how a user arrived at the point when the app crashed. Developers won\\u2019t already use Crash Reporting and Firebase Analytics won\\u2019t need to add any additional code to their apps to get access to this new feature. Mostly, though, developers will want to avoid crashes. At its I/O developers conference six months ago, Google announced the launch of Firebase Test Lab , its remote testing service (previously also known as the Google Cloud Test Lab). With today\\u2019s update, the Firebase Test Lab gets a free tier that allows developers to run up to five tests on physical\\xa0Android devices (and ten on virtual devices) per day \\u2014 no credit card required. For game developers, Google\\xa0built a new Unity plugin that supports Firebase Analytics, its real-time database, authentication, dynamic links, remote config, notifications and other core Firebase features. Also new is version 1.0 of the FirebaseUI, which offers developers common UI elements for building their apps (think authentication, etc.) and a new \\u201cFirebase in a Weekend\\u201d course the company developed with Udacity. The company\\xa0made these announcements at its Firebase Dev Summit in Berlin today.',\n",

       "  u'https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/a-freespee-for-all/',\n",
       "  u'Freespee , which these days calls itself a \\u201creal-time conversation cloud technology company,\\u201d has raised \\u20ac9.25 million in Series B funding. French venture capital firm Ventech led the round, alongside existing investors Sunstone Capital and Inventure. Silicon Valley Bank also participated, signalling that this is a mixture equity and debt financing. Founded all the way back in 2009, Freespee has come a long way since its original click-to-call ad proposition . It no longer positions itself as an adtech company that makes it easier for online brands to encourage customers to call, including offering click-to-call analytics, but instead offers a much broader cloud marketing platform, with a focus on \\u201cconversational commerce\\u201d. The Freespee platform lets companies keep track of and measure the return of investment for conversations it has with prospective customers that originate from a brand\\u2019s own web property or mobile app, regardless of what channel \\u2014 phone, chat or email \\u2014 those conversations take place. It also enables the resulting marketing to be personalised for each customer. \\u201cThere is no simple way for a brand to understand how customer communications through phone, chat and email influence and help grow its internet business,\\u201d Says Carl Holmquist, Freespee co-founder and CEO, in a statement. \\u201cWe\\u2019re building a cloud that gives marketers and e-commerce professionals access to these legacy technology stacks\\u201d. Holmquist\\u2019s reference to \\u201clegacy technology stacks\\u201d refers to the way conversations with customers across email, a pop up chat box on a company\\u2019s website, or via a click-to-call phone call, typically sit in silos that make it difficult to integrate into existing marketing, analytics and CRM tools. Customer conversations often jump from one channel to the next, perhaps starting with an email and moving to a phone call, posing another problem for a company\\u2019s marketing department and how it can possibly measure return of investment (ROI). The result is that it\\u2019s difficult or impossible for marketers to track return of investment for a particular campaign or channel, or to personalise their marketing message accordingly. Freespee aims to consolidate this conversation data to give brands the full conversational commerce picture. As an example, a prospective customer may visit a carmaker\\u2019s mobile website, look at a few models, and eventually book a test drive over the phone and via click-to-call. However, without tracking the customer from one conversation channel to another there is a high likelihood that, thanks to re-targeting, they\\u2019ll see ads prompting them to book a test drive when they have already done so. In this instance a different ad or message would be more appropriate. To that end, Freespee counts major brands such as Allianz, Lloyds, eBay, Bupa, Marriott Hotels and Peugeot, as customers. \\u201cBy working with Ventech and our other investors, new and old, we will continue to pioneer new ways to allow our customers to monitor, manage and personalise the experience of every conversation taking place through their desktop web, mobile web and apps,\\u201d adds Holmquist.',\n",

       "  u'GoOpti might be described as an Uber (or UberPOOL) for independent shuttle bus providers. It connects travellers from smaller European cities who want to travel to or from larger city airport hubs, and in doing so ensures economies of scale so that laying on a shuttle bus is viable. \\u201cOur platform is a marketplace that is solving problems on demand and supply side,\\u201d GoOpti co-founder and CEO Marko Gu\\u010dek tells me. \\u201cOn demand side we have people living in the cities, which do not have a local airport or have one with a scarce number of direct flights, which usually means higher prices of tickets\\u201d. The solution for those passengers is, of course, to travel to the nearest airport hub city, but that is typically 1-3 hours away or more. Currently, most people drive, but this means \\u201cexpensive fuel and toll costs, airport parking fees and unsafe driving after long and tiring flights\\u201d. Others ask friends to drive them but this means double the cost since it amounts to four journeys. Instead, by pooling prospective customers and using variable pricing to nudge them towards the most viable shuttle service and time of departure, together with an algorithm that predicts demand, GoOpti gives travellers a cheaper and greener option. It also helps struggling shuttle companies. \\u201cOn the other side there is local supply of transportation companies with vans and mini buses, which used to work mostly for business travellers and private groups, but due to changes in the industry have a challenge of decreasing business or stronger competition,\\u201d explains Gu\\u010dek. In addition, shuttle bus owners are often managers and drivers, which means they work long hours, are available to their clients and drivers 24/7, but with no guaranteed income. \\u201cTransportation companies get access to an innovative business model, our customers, fleet management tools, a unified support centre and guaranteed yearly income if dedicated. In short we take the stress away on both sides by putting them together in the way both sides are satisfied\\u201d. To help with that mission, GoOpti \\u2014 which is currently operational in Slovenia, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia \\u2014 has raised \\u20ac4.4 million in new funding. \\u20ac1.5 of that comes via a European Union grant, whiles investors in the company\\u2019s Series A include EBRD, Point Nine, and RTA. The new capital will be used to expand further across several European locations.',\n",

       "  u'Opera has rolled out\\xa0a set of\\xa0privacy features\\xa0to its data-saving proxy for Android, Opera Max .\\xa0It\\u2019s now billing it\\xa0as a \\u201cdata management and privacy app\\u201d. The company\\xa0previewed the\\xa0new privacy mode last month, saying\\xa0it would be starting a gradual rollout \\u2014 with the feature first available in Samsung\\u2019s S Secure mode on the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime and Galaxy J7 Prime phones. Today it says the privacy features are\\xa0now\\xa0available to all Opera Max users, regardless of the Android device they\\u2019re using. Opera Max\\xa0originally\\xa0launched in February 2014, with a focus on bandwidth and data consumption, with the company\\xa0touting the free app as a way for Android users to save money. Opera says the idea with the new privacy mode is to expand the app to create a \\u201cprivacy timeline\\u201d in addition to the \\u201cdata usage timeline\\u201d,\\xa0by providing a breakdown of how apps on the device are sharing data with third parties. \\u201cWe want to educate our users by revealing which apps are sharing your data through trackers without your permission,\\u201d said\\xa0Sergey Lossev, Opera Max\\u2019s head of product, in a statement. Although, with more apps offering their own data compression features \\u2014 Facebook, for example, expanded its suite of data \\u2018lite\\u2019 apps to include Messenger last month \\u2014 Opera Max arguably needs to do more than just data compression if it\\u2019s to keep attracting users. The new privacy mode on Opera Max lets users\\xa0view\\xa0real-time privacy alerts\\xa0by\\xa0scrolling up and down the timeline. They can also\\xa0tap on individual timeline cards to drill into a\\xa0\\u201cprivacy breakdown\\u201d of what an app did in a particular session. Although some reviewers are critical of how clearly this information is presented. Another new feature is the ability for users to push a button to encrypt all app data and browsing traffic \\u2014 to offer\\xa0an additional layer of \\u201cindustry-standard TLS/SSL protection\\u201d when using unencrypted apps on a public Wi-Fi or mobile network. Also\\xa0included: an ad tracker blocker feature, based on\\xa0the open source EasyPrivacy filter list , aimed at reducing how much ad profiling Opera Max users are subject to. Although another user of Opera Max posting a review on Google Play notes the app can\\u2019t be used to restrict Opera\\u2019s own apps. And, rather ironically, Opera does display some ads within Opera Max to, in its words, \\u201ckeep the app free for all our users\\u201d. But in the words of another reviewer of the app: \\u201cI wonder how much data I would be saving if the near constant and extremely annoying parade of ads was to go away. I would rather pay for a pro version than deal with this BS, so I am uninstalling this (cr)app.\\u201d As well as complaining about an apparently\\xa0increased volume of ads within the app, multiple users are also unhappy that the new version requires them to interact with it more frequently (every 12 hours vs every seven days) to keep it active. An Opera spokesperson responding on Google Play to criticisms of the app\\xa0becoming\\xa0\\u2018nagware\\u2019 argues that\\xa0having users\\xa0using the app \\u201conly when you need it\\u201d should decrease the load on its\\xa0servers \\u201cand make Opera Max more efficient\\u201d. But, from users\\u2019 point of view, the new more intrusive interface for Opera Max looks to be\\xa0rather less efficient to use. \\u201cThe \\u2018old\\u2019 version just ran in the background doing it\\u2019s data saving thing. But now it\\u2019s constantly popping up reminding me to reset some kind of timer. I\\u2019ll give it a run for a while and see if it still saves data or not,\\u201d adds another reviewer.',\n",

       "  u' It\\u2019s been several months since Alibaba\\u2019s blockbuster acquisition of Lazada, the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. When the news broke, pundits and critics debated whether or not each side got a good deal, how it would impact rivals like MatahariMall, Tokopedia and Orami, and how the region would be flooded with cheap Chinese products. Elsewhere, startup founders and VCs high-fived each other as the move put the region on the global map and they hoped it would lead to more funding and exits in the future. However, everyone has failed to go beyond superficial observations. Alibaba\\u2019s acquisition of Lazada is much more than simply growing retail GMV, proving exactly why Jack Ma is Jack Ma and why he\\u2019s always been several steps ahead of the game. Those celebrating the news, especially those in the retail space, may end up biting their tongues. Peter Thiel, PayPal and Why Distribution Matters In his book \\u2018 Zero to One \\u2019, Peter Thiel talks about how PayPal almost didn\\u2019t survive were it not for their lucky break stumbling onto what would become their biggest distribution channel, growth engine, and eventual acquirer: eBay. PayPal focused on targeting eBay\\u2019s Power Sellers \\u2014 those responsible for the bulk of volume going through eBay \\u2014 and then amplified it by paying for user sign ups and invites to friends, effectively turning PayPal into a mainstream payments platform. No wonder Peter Thiel has been such a fervent proponent of distribution , beyond just building a great product. \\u201cPoor distribution \\u2014 not product \\u2014 is the number one cause of failure. If you can get even a single distribution channel to work, you have great business. If you try for several but don\\u2019t nail one, you\\u2019re finished,\\u201d Thiel writes. eBay accelerated PayPal\\u2019s growth thanks to its reach and velocity of transactions \\u2014 high usage kept the payments company thriving. Distribution is exactly what Alibaba needs Lazada for. But for what? Most definitely not cheap Chinese products. Inside The Belly of The Beast Around the same time\\xa0that Peter Thiel\\u2019s PayPal was acquired by eBay, the latter company was attempting to grab market share in China through an investment into \\u2014 and eventual acquisition of \\u2014 EachNet in 2002, at that time the leading Chinese C2C marketplace. In response to this, Alibaba launched Taobao in May 2003 and eventually beat EachNet to become China\\u2019s largest consumer-to-consumer e-commerce marketplace. In a timespan of 3-4 years, eBay\\u2019s C2C market share plummeted from 72% to 8% and caused them to throw in the towel while Taobao\\u2019s share continued to climb, reaching over 80% by 2007. Shortly after Taobao\\u2019s launch, Alibaba introduced Alipay, a third-party online payment platform, in 2004 to help facilitate transactions on Taobao. Today, Alipay is China\\u2019s largest third-party payment platform with 70% market share, boasting over 400 million users and generating over 80 million transactions per day (compared to PayPal\\u2019s 9 million). Whereas PayPal was primarily a peer-to-peer (P2P) online payments platform based on email and linked to credit cards, Alipay was connected to bank accounts and incorporated features tailored to the Chinese market, such as escrow services. According to Jack Ma , Chinese culture, despite being one that traditionally values trust and integrity, lacked a system that enforced it. As a result, Alipay\\u2019s escrow feature was a perfect solution to the trust gap and shifted China\\u2019s e-commerce behavior away from cash-on-delivery (COD) towards one that is seeing 68% of transactions today. With Taobao\\u2019s massive reach and distribution \\u2014 423 million annual active buyers and over 90% of total C2C ecommerce GMV in China \\u2014 Alipay was able to cement its position as the leading third-party payment method. Leveraging its 400 million users and reach through Alibaba e-commerce platforms, Alipay has grown beyond being an Internet-based payment platform into a finance and banking behemoth to the extent of threatening the old financial guard. In 2011, Alipay spun off Alibaba to become Ant Financial Services Group, covering everything from online payments to microlending to banking and credit scores. Based on its recent funding round of $4.5 billion earlier this year, the group is now valued at $60 billion, making it the second most valuable non-public tech company behind Uber. With this new war chest, Ant Financial looked to expand into new markets and for a while had been trying to get a foot into Southeast Asia . The company set up a Singapore entity as early as 2010 but lacked a proper distribution channel. Ant Financial\\u2019s lucky break seems to have arrived earlier this year. Eyeing The Payments Opportunity in Southeast Asia In many ways, Southeast Asia e-commerce is like China e-commerce but 8 years younger. Back in 2008, cash-on-delivery (COD) was still the dominant payment method in China making up over 70% of payments . Today, Southeast Asians rely heavily on COD when shopping online, attributing to roughly 70% of transactions . To wean customers off a high dependency on COD, many well-funded startups and established conglomerates have been trying to solve the payments bottleneck, including Omise (Thailand), Doku (Indonesia), LINE Pay (Thailand), and True Money (Thailand). Despite the PR and media hype, these homegrown solutions have yet to shift consumers away from COD because a lot of these heroic efforts have been \\u201ctechnology for technology\\u2019s sake\\u201d \\u2014 building a faster car when what is really lacking are more roads The Product Challenge The Distribution Challenge The (Lack of a) Use Case Challenge Ecommerce is a more obvious and natural use case and therefore True Money is also used as a payment gateway on Ascend\\u2019s ecommerce properties WeMall and WeLoveShopping . However, with only 26% of Lazada\\u2019s traffic , Ascend still has a long way to go before taking a page out of Peter Thiel\\u2019s playbook and turning its ecommerce properties into a fertile breeding ground for its payment solutions. The Lazada Acquisition: A Trojan Horse Strategy? Alibaba\\u2019s foray into Southeast Asia has never really been about growing retail GMV. In the long run, it\\u2019s not so much about beating Lazada\\u2019s direct rivals or tapping into new growth markets outside of China; it\\u2019s about securing access to a massive end user base in a market whose lack of commerce infrastructure is eerily similar to early days China. Jack Ma\\u2019s endgame is to introduce and monetize his other products and services, starting with Alipay. Adopting Alipay would be pivotal for the region\\u2019s e-commerce growth and that of Lazada in particular. Widespread adoption of a convenient payment platform that bridges the trust gap between buyers and sellers will lead to more transactions overall as witnessed in China, now the world\\u2019s biggest e-commerce market in terms of GMV and penetration . Alibaba\\u2019s (ironic) 20% stake in Ascend Money , the parent group of True Money, coming just a few months after the Lazada deal, shows Jack Ma\\u2019s master plan for Southeast Asia gradually coming to fruition. But it\\u2019s much more than just Alipay and facilitating marketplace payments. As highlighted earlier, Ant Financial, Alipay\\u2019s parent company, operates an entire digital finance ecosystem in China consisting of but not limited to: Yu\\u2019e Bao , the biggest mutual fund in China in terms of investors with $108 billion in assets; Zhaocai Bao , a P2P lending platform with $32 billion in transactions in its first year; and Sesame Credit , a credit-scoring system based on \\u2014 you\\u2019ve guessed it \\u2014 ecommerce data. And finance is only scratching the surface. Jack Ma, in his 2015 letter to shareholders , hints at much more to come: Hence it shouldn\\u2019t be retailers like MatahariMall or Central that should be worried about increased competition; instead, banks, insurers, hospitals and everyone else should start preparing for some ass whoopin\\u2019 For a preview of what could be coming up in Southeast Asia one only needs to look at what happened to Uber recently in China. Learnings From China or How Alibaba\\u2019s Trojan Horse Strategy Killed Uber China \\u201cUber didn\\u2019t lose in China in 2016. They lost in 2014 when they got in, and found out 2 years later .\\u201d \\u2014 Wang Di, Quora User Alibaba, partnering up with long-time frenemy Tencent, adopted a similar strategy in China to take out Uber. Outsiders often point to the classic textbook \\u201cwhy-foreign-Internet-companies-fail-in-China\\u201d excuses like lack of localization (culture/language barrier), lack of connections/guanxi , government  protection , and lack of IP law enforcement. Although these do apply to a certain degree, none of them get to the core of why Uber failed in China. Uber failed because it thought it was competing against Didi in the smart transportation space. Little did they know that Didi\\u2019s majority shareholders, Alibaba and Tencent, were playing according to an entirely different set of rules. For Alibaba (and Tencent), Didi wasn\\u2019t just a ride-hailing app; Didi\\u2019s strategic and hidden purpose was to serve as a scalable user acquisition channel for Alipay Wallet, Alipay\\u2019s mobile version, as well as Tencent\\u2019s WeChat Wallet, according to this brilliant Quora answer : The Chinese were not familiar with mobile payment at that time. In fact, no large group of people in the world were significantly better than the Chinese either. Moreover, the Chinese were mostly quite cautious when paying online, and a lot of them are not exactly fans of novelty gadgets. But how they love discounts or kickbacks! A dollar saved is a dollar earned. The cab-calling apps Didi and Kuaidi became perfect for user traffic introductions. Users could tap Didi to call a cab and pay 30 yuan in cash, but if they paid the cabbie by Tencent Wallet (redirected from Didi), they would only have to pay 10. Were users willing to save 20 yuan\\u20143 or 4 US dollars\\u2014by using an already built-in feature in another app? Just a few taps here and there? Hell yeah. And then they were hooked-up with WeChat Wallet. Which was what Tencent really wanted. With Didi as a key distribution channel for Alipay Wallet, Alibaba was able to acquire more users into its ecosystem of services including Taobao, Tmall, Ant Finance and much more, leading to monetization across different products. Uber only had transportation. Tencent and Alibaba have been throwing unthinkable amounts of money to pay for all the unbelievable kickbacks. Unthinkable for a cab-calling app, but totally reasonable if you want to mark your territory in the biggest market in the world that is most advanced in mobile payment. What The Future Holds for Southeast Asia With Southeast Asia being hailed as the next big and untapped ecommerce market in the world, we are seeing many players subsidizing their way into growth through discounts and coupons. Not surprisingly, critics often look at this as a race to the bottom for everyone. Not entirely true. As the Uber China example has shown us, this will only be the case for companies that fail to look at the bigger picture and are unable to monetize through a diversified set of products or services, whether now or in the future. With all this in mind, one could argue that Alibaba got a pretty good deal with Lazada, especially given the long-term opportunities in SEA beyond retail ecommerce. A quick look at Alibaba\\u2019s stock confirms this\\u2014Alibaba\\u2019s share price jumped after the April 12 acquisition announcement and has increased by 35% ever since (as of October 3, 2016). Alibaba\\u2019s acquisition is widely considered a victory for the growth of ecommerce in SEA but how many of us here are ready to face the fact that whatever trophy we hauled in may not be a shiny unicorn but perhaps something else?',\n",

       "  u'With more online shoppers turning to sites like Amazon, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have had to step up their competition on the e-commerce front \\u2013 including by offering faster deliveries \\u2013 or risk losing customers. The latest to join the fight is PetSmart , which today is rolling out a\\xa0redesigned, mobile-friendly website offering same-day, scheduled deliveries and subscriptions, among other new features. The changes\\xa0are designed to make it easier to order the sort of regular pet staples that shoppers need, like food, over-the-counter medicines, grooming supplies, litter and bedding, toys, treats, and more. Like Amazon, PetSmart shoppers can opt to subscribe to frequent orders through a new \\u201cauto-ship\\u201d option that lets you choose to have items delivered on a schedule you prefer \\u2013 anywhere from between 2 to 8 weeks \\u2013 in exchange for a 5 percent discount, along with free shipping. The new shipping\\xa0options are powered last-mile logistics\\xa0provider, Deliv . With Deliv\\u2019s service integrated into PetSmart\\u2019s checkout flow, customers can choose same-day delivery in the 17 markets (2,500 zip codes) where Deliv operates. At launch, same-day,available for a $7.99 fee, is available in\\xa0Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco, San Jose, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Miami, Seattle and Chicago. By mid-November, it will arrive\\xa0Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Boston, New York City, Yonkers, Northern New Jersey and Washington D.C. In addition, Deliv\\u2019s integration means customers can choose to customize\\xa0their delivery schedules. Delivery can be set within a few hours of purchase, up to two days later, through the new feature, says PetSmart. And all this takes place on a new, one-page checkout screen, meant to boost conversations and cut down on cart abandonment rates. Along with the changes, the\\xa0PetSmart.com website, powered by SalesForce Commerce Cloud, has been completely overhauled. The design has been optimized for mobile devices, like phones and tablets, and the shopping cart will be mirrored between desktop and mobile. A native mobile application is also expected to launch in a matter of weeks. The ship-to-store option has been improved, too, as PetSmart\\u2019s site will show in-store product availability. Plus, when items aren\\u2019t available in-store, the company is offering the option to ship to customers\\u2019 homes for free. Pet grooming and boarding services can also now be booked online, via the new site. And customers can opt to receive text message about deals, through an opt-in SMS service. Overall, the upgraded site is a major move from PetSmart, which today operates 1,477 pet stores across the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, along with its digital brands, PetSmart.com, PetFoodDirect.com, Pet360.com and petMD.com. Acquired in 2015 by a consortium led by BC Partners for $8.7 billion, PetSmart has since increased profits and sales, and expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint. But ignoring the online threat is not an option for the retailer. \\u201cOur omnichannel strategy is aimed at giving pet parents options tailored to their needs and desires,\\u201d said Eran Cohen, PetSmart\\u2019s \\u201cchief customer experience officer,\\u201d in a statement about the launch. \\u201cWe look forward to seeing their response to the new site with its new user experience and commerce-meets-content approach, as well as to our expanded and convenient home delivery options, which capitalize on our extensive store network for same-day and scheduled delivery,\\u201d he added. This isn\\u2019t the first time PetSmart has experimented with more modern delivery options. Before today, PetSmart has been participating in Google\\u2019s same-day delivery service, Google Express, which recently expanded across the U.S. For Deliv, meanwhile, PetSmart is another big win for the delivery provider, who has previously done deals with Best Buy , Walgreens , Macy\\u2019s, and even Walmart, in select test markets , among others.',\n",
