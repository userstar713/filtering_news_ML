"Blade Angel, Another Retroesque Gem In The Present!

  We got it with Mega Man 9 and it seems we got it with Blade Angel, a fresh and truly retro gaming experience!    Perusing the Applications store of my IPhone’s overlord I ran into a title I had eyed many of times, Blade Angel. In previous encounters we had merely stopped, shrugged, and continued on. You see, she was a pricey title looking for a owner with a serious itch, and I was a simple schmo looking for a simple game. So, imagine my surprise when I run into this little butter scout, wearing nothing but a shiny red tag with the glorious engravings “$0.99”. Truly, the heavens were shining on me today!  With a sale so delicious, so IMPURE.. how couldn’t I? Purchase, that is what MSSG Studio just got.  So, with 10 minutes and a level or two done, I have my impression. Blade Angel, easily and lazily put, is a scrolling action title that combines elements of Mega Man and Metal Slug (and in the case of the localization, Zero Wing.) The mechanics are simple. You can run, slide, jump, double jump, shoot, and use a “special” move. You also have an assortment of items you can procure with the game’s currency. Using this currency you are also able to level up your founding attributes (Power, Speed, Range.) Screen play consists of a screen locked into place until you vanquish any on-screen enemies (called, humorously I hope, the P-crusaders.) The main character is even a prepubescent girl – well, I presume it must be a girl – named Pafu, sporting revealing clothing and a pink fetish.  All this combines to become your arsenal, of which you need to use to rescue your Dr. and mentor, whom can only be assumed has developed some ungodly machine of questionable use to humanity, as you collect bottles! (Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention, she is also some sort of “bottle picker”. Yeah.)  All in all, it seems Blade Angel is a nice piece of retro-ham. Hilarious with its poor excuse for “English”, simple in its execution, it has so far provided an experience that is retro to the point where its quality could honestly be debated either way. If your an IPhone whore looking for something to satiate your digital desires, maybe it’s time to hit up the app store!  Oh, and for the good of your financial stability and social standing, don’t do a google text or image search for “Blade Angel” with safe search off in view of the general public!

"Read+Watch+Listen: Bonus Material For Wolfenstein: The New Order Fans

 This article may contain spoilers for Wolfenstein: The New Order.   You spent years waiting for developers to hurry up and release a big game. You buy it, take it home, and play through it in a couple of days. It’s awesome.  But now what?  Read+Watch+Listen is about other material you might want to check out if you’re just not ready to move on. We’ll suggest media that share something in common with a particular game and tell you why it might be of interest. This time, we’re supplementing Wolfenstein: The New Order, which came out for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360, and PC a couple of weeks ago. We mostly liked it .  ‘Iron Sky’  If you couldn’t get enough of: Nazi moon bases.  This 2012 kinda-tribute to director Stanley Kubrick’s Cold War classic Dr. Strangelove supposes that the remnants of the Third Reich escaped to a swastika-shaped compound on the moon instead of someplace normal, like South America. The movie’s a bit hazy on how exactly they did that, but cult-hero actor Udo Kier plays the regime’s new Führer, so that should be sufficient incentive to suspend your disbelief.  Above: OK, so it is a little silly. Image Credit: fanart.tv  Of course, being Nazis, their first priority is returning to Earth as conquerers, and they do so with a fleet of flying saucers. But that’s fairly incidental because the whole point of the movie is Moon Nazis. Why wasn’t it called “Moon Nazis”? The mockbuster factory The Asylum’s knockoff version was called Nazis at the Center of The Earth , and that tells you everything you need to know. Both films are available for streaming on Netflix Instant. Iron Sky even has a Director’s Cut available with some extra scenes and lens flare. No, really.  Uchronia  If you couldn’t get enough of: Alternate-history shenanigans.  Above: It’s a good time to start assembling your summer reading list. Image Credit: Uchronia  If you’re interested in other what-if scenarios like the weird version of 1960 from The New Order but don’t know where to start, you might want to head over to Uchronia . It’s a massive bibliography containing thousands of listings of alternate history works. Topics include the well-covered “The Allies lose World War II” and “The Confederacy wins the American Civil War” as well as other subjects like “The dinosaurs never went extinct” and “What if the Earth’s axis were nearly parallel with its orbit?”  Things would be very different in those cases. Hitler would actually be the least of our worries.  OK, hear me out: Dinosaur Hitler.  Nobody steal that.  ‘Beliebte Lieder auf Deutsch’  If you couldn’t get enough of: Wolfenstein’s Nazi record label .  Above: Most of the songs were original, but you probably spotted the references to Die Käfer (“The Beetles”) and an alternate version of the Abbey Road album cover. Image Credit: YouTube  Players who weren’t too busy mowing down Nazis and their robots probably noticed the little clues scattered throughout levels about just how completely German had conquered the world.  One of the most fun artifacts is Neumond, the fictional record label that represents what would happen if all of the world’s popular culture had to pass through the Fatherland (and its fleet of censors). It’s more or less the same kinds of music our universe had in 1960, but it’s all very, very German.  If you’re looking for something a little more surreal, I’ve assembled a YouTube playlist for your enjoyment: It’s all popular musicians singing their own songs in German. And that’s every bit as amazing as it sounds. Check it out below:    I haven’t read, watched, and listened to everything, obviously.

"Samsung Makes The Android-Powered Intercept For Sprint Official

We heard a few murmurs about this phone earlier this week, but the actual date of its launch escaped us. As it turns out, today is the day for Samsung’s mid-range Android handset to hit: it’s riding the publicity wave of mega-phones like the EVO and Galaxy line, but sports decidedly less impressive specs. Still, it looks like a perfectly capable and fairly attractive phone, available on Sprint for $100 after a $100 rebate. It’s got vanilla 2.1 on it, with no word on 2.2. Headed your way July 11th – more info here and an early video hands-on here . Can’t say I like the color scheme, though.

"When To Use Vine And When To Use Instagram

 This is a guest post by Anish Patel, CEO of Revolution Productions .  As video becomes the most popular way to share information, companies are vying to be the top platform. The latest craze has been Instagram launching video capabilities, putting it in competition with Vine.  While many comment on the rivalry of Instagram vs. Vine, the problem isn’t which is a better platform. The problem is that companies have posted content on both sites and gotten no results. Is it a fault of the platforms? Think again. Instead of commenting about how Instagram can outperform Vine, we need to focus on how each platform should be used.  When to Use Vine  Vine is one of the most intriguing platforms available today, mostly because the video content is limited to six seconds. The GIF-style has easy integration with Twitter, making the videos shareable in real-time.  Vine is a great tool for:  New Product Features : Since you only have six seconds, flashing a feature or new product gives just enough time for users to want to find out more. Watch how Revlon featured their new lipstick.   Live interaction with customers: Sometimes a quick answer is all that’s needed. Watch how Honda responded to their fans in real-time using quirky Vine responses, here.  http://twitter.com/Honda/statuses/356796960126152704  How-To Videos : Show how to use your tool, by showing viewers in video. Watch how Cadbury took advantage of Vine here:   Invitations to events : Creatively showcase details and address information of an event with a Vine promo video.  Video teasers : Show a snippet of an upcoming event or newly introduced product. The six seconds will give viewers just enough to want more.  When to use Instagram Video  Instagram has become the latest sensation for video marketers with their whopping 15 seconds of sharable video. The already popular photo site took advantage of their fanbase of over 130 million users and updated their platform while video is still a hot marketing tool (Genius). The filters and video editing ability gives the platform a competitive edge. Since Instagram already has a large user base, we recommend using InstagramVideos for:  Promotional Campaigns : Having nine more seconds to feature a video can showcase a bit more about your product. A great example is with Lulumon’s latest Instagram video:       Every mat has a story to tell. #justmymat  A video posted by lululemon (@lululemon) on Jun 20, 2013 at 10:20am PDT    Video Series : What better way to continually engage users than with a cohesive video campaign. Create a theme and carry it out with a few videos to show off some personality with your brand. Tutorials to feature your products: Watch how Starbucks does it in this video:       A flawless way to a perfect cup. #Clover  A video posted by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Jul 23, 2013 at 1:56pm PDT    Commercial Style Videos : Humor is difficult to achieve in video, but, with the additional time, your videos are able to simulate TV commercials better. Humor is difficult to achieve in video, but, with the additional time, your videos are able to simulate TV commercials better. Here is a great demonstration for Taco Bell:       Nacho Cheese. Cool Ranch. What's next? It's coming 8.22.13. #_DLT  A video posted by Taco Bell (@tacobell) on Aug 1, 2013 at 9:42am PDT    As you can see, both platforms offer incredible features for businesses. The trick is understanding how to use the platforms to your advantage. Once you do, you will on the road to viral video success.

"Glance Is A Kickstarter Project That Turns Any Watch Into A Smartwatch

 Love the idea of owning a smartwatch but hate the idea of giving up your existing watch? Glance is a tiny add-on that gives your wrist the best features of a smartwatch at a rock-bottom price.  Wearables — and smartwatches in particular — are just about all anyone in the technosphere wants to talk about right now (well, except for our current and hopefully short-lived obsession with dumb apps that do next to nothing ).  There’s good reason for this interest. Smartwatches hold the promise of being able to free you from pulling out your phone every time you need to see who’s texting or calling you, plus their embedded sensors could enable a digital-health revolution.  Trouble is, without exception, every smartwatch that has hit the market is about as beautiful as a Casio Calculator Watch (sorry, hipster Casio nerds). If you are amongst the millions of people who have spent some serious cash to own a high-end timepiece, you pretty much have to shelve that work of chronographic art indefinitely while you avail yourself of the utilities that a smartwatch can bring to your wrist.  That just isn’t right.  Thank goodness a team of Canadian inventors is here to rescue our old-fashioned, Bluetoothless relics from the underwear drawer with their Kickstarter project aptly called “Glance.”  Simply put, Glance is like a smartwatch greatest-hits collection of features housed in a thin and light curved chunk of aluminum that can be worn under the strap of your existing watch. At first Glance (hah!), it sounds and looks horrible and uncomfortable. Its creators promise that isn’t so .  According to its project page, the Glance can do most of the things a Pebble can do, for far less than half the price (backers can get in on the Glance action starting at $70 plus shipping), plus a thing or two the Pebble can’t do (more on that in a moment).  Packing a 3D motion sensor, Bluetooth 4.0, and a high-contrast (albeit tiny) OLED display, the Glance can show you notifications for incoming calls, let you read incoming text message via a scrolling system called “Spritz,” and respond to said text messages with the touch of button (or a shake of the wrist!) using canned messages such as “Can’t respond, I’m juggling three chainsaws” or perhaps the more likely “Can’t respond, I’m driving.”    But wait, there’s more! (Cue informerical music…)  The Glance can be used as an “air mouse” to control your Smart TV or computer (the Glance app will let you configure these options) and track your activity (naturally – who doesn’t want to track everything these days?). Best of all, the thing is waterproof and available in both silver and gold, which might make it the first gadget that actually has a reason to come in gold. It will also be manufactured in three different widths for compatibility with the greatest number of wrists and watchstraps.  Of course, if you’re under the age of 30, there’s a good chance you view any watch as a sure sign that its wearer is from a distant analog past and should probably be offered a does of Geritol with their half-caff latte. For you, Glance can be worn watch-free with the bracelet of your choice.  Someday, hopefully in the not-too-distant-future, all watches will be able to give us an untethered connection to our digital lives. But in the meantime, we have Glance.  So grab your Rolex or TAGHeuer or Ebel watch, dust it off and then reach for your credit card. You, my friend, are about to have a Glance (hah!) at the future. Just don’t delay. There are only 12 days to go, and the founders are only a third of their way to their funding goal.  Simon Cohen is one of Canada’s most experienced consumer tech voices and has appeared nationally online as well as on TV and radio.

"Line’S User-Generated Sticker Market Made $75M During Its First Year

Last May, messaging app Line launched its Creators Market , a platform that lets all users make and sell stickers. Now Line has disclosed how the platform performed during its freshman year (a followup to its six-month report released in November). Between May 8, 2014, when stickers first became available for purchase, and May 7, 2015, over 390,000 creators from 156 countries registered stickers for sale on the platform. Combined, they made a total of JPY 8.946 billion (about $75 million). Line did not disclose who the market’s best performers are, but it did say that the makers of the top ten selling individual sticker sets earned an average of JPY 50.5 million (about $421,000). Many creators have multiple sticker sets for sale and, from that group, the top ten sellers earned an average of JPY 109 million (or $909,000). The company did not say how much all sellers made on average. Like most other open marketplaces, there will be a handful of breakout stars while most sellers remain relatively obscure and make much smaller sums. For its top performers, however, Line Creators Market is a valuable platform that exposes their art to 205 million monthly active users. In its release, Line said that “many characters originally designed as creators’ stickers have received merchandising and publishing deals, and more still have gone on to collaborate with other corporations, proving that the sticker-based platform has become an incubator for creativity and nurturing new ideas.” Squeezing More Money Out Of Stickers This “incubator” is also another way for Line to hatch more revenue. The company, which delayed an initial public offering last year to focus on increasing its revenue and profit, announced that it will launch a service called Line Creators Management, which is meant to help sticker creators apply for trademarks and sign merchandising deals with other companies. Line said the service has already struck partnerships with Tokyo toy maker T-ARTS Company. Line didn’t reveal what kind of revenue-sharing plan will be put in place for Creators Management (TechCrunch has contacted the company for more information). The Creators Market originally gave sticker makers a 50 percent share of revenue, but lowered that to 35 percent for stickers registered after Feb. 1 . Line said it needed more funds to enhance the Creators Market . Today it revealed that these improvements will include making the messaging app’s sticker market easier to search and displaying Creators Market stickers alongside “official” stickers, which feature characters from Line and companies it has licensing deals with, such as Disney. This is a potential boon for sticker creators, since their offerings are currently lumped into a separate category. Beyond Stickers Stickers are a Line signature and key to its popularity in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand (its top three markets), but they represent just a part of the $656 million in revenue it made in 2014 . Games users play through their Line accounts currently make up 60 percent of Line’s gross sales, but the segment has suffered from weaker performance over the past few quarters . It’s important for Line Corp to find new monetization streams as it tries to increase its valuation. The company has been investing in everything from mobile payments and streaming music to food delivery, taxi calling, and even indoor mapping. The aim of this multi-pronged approach is to turn Line into a lifestyle platform packed with essential services that will keep users coming back even after the novelty of stickers and games wear off. It’s still early to tell how well this plan (which includes a $42 million fund to invest in startups that can potentially be integrated into Line’s apps) will pay off, but similar growth strategies are being deployed by other major Asian messaging apps, including WeChat and KakaoTalk, and in turn influencing Western products like Facebook Messenger .

"Twitter Is Fixing That Thing Where You Type “.@” For Everyone To See Your Tweet

 Twitter disclosed today a decline in monthly active users. Now the company knows it’s got to do better. One way it will do that is to adjust the way that users reply to each other’s tweets.  “We are going to fix the broken windows and confusing parts, like the .@name syntax and @reply rules, that we know inhibit usage and drive people away,” Twitter said in its quarterly earnings statement for the fourth quarter of 2015.  The company has done a lot to tweak its product — the algorithmic timeline and Moments are probably the biggest recent changes — but one thing that Twitter users have done to make sure their replies get seen by a wider audience is using a period before typing in a Twitter user’s handle. Otherwise, replies can get buried. This will change.  The “.” thing isn’t necessarily obvious for new users. It’s the type of thing power users know and have begrudgingly embraced as a kludgy workaround. Perhaps this will rub power users the right way. And that will be a good thing considering how many of them have been reacting negatively to the news about algorithmically selected tweets being surfaced in people’s timelines as an opt-in feature.  .@Twitter thanks.  Update April 26: Twitter still hasn’t fixed that thing. It’s reporting its first-quarter 2016 earnings today.

"Andreessen And Horowitz Explain Why The Firm’S Partners Are Donating Half Their Vc Income To Charity

In the grand tradition of industry barons — but not so much venture capitalists — the six general partners at Andreessen Horowitz are donating at least half of the income from their investing activities to philanthropy. The firm has already been turning heads up and down Sand Hill Road, but this move might cause some whiplash. Sure, American capitalists have been donating large portions of their wealth since the 19th century. And sure, the newest generation of tech titans, like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, are following in their footsteps. But VCs have not traditionally done so, at least at the firm level; major philanthropy in the industry has mostly come from individuals, like John Doerr and Michael Moritz. And some investors may be more philosophically opposed. There’s a school of thought in Silicon Valley that goes something like this: the products built by companies are what make the biggest impact, and nonprofits are less efficient. So invest back into companies and you’ll help the world more than anything else you could try. I talked to Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz today about the announcement, to hear why they believe charity is the best way for them to contribute to the world more than they already have. “We didn’t have any exotic hobbies like polo or something or when we started the firm,” Horowitz explained, so instead, they’d both already gotten involved in giving, having come off a huge $1.6 billion exit with Opsware among others (check out this New York Times article from last year for more on Andreessen’s efforts). It was more recently that one of the partners, Scott Weiss , brought up the giving-half idea — something that Gates, Warren Buffett and others have been promoting in recent years. The firm, whose partners are all very successful entrepreneurs, got on board. And not just because of the direct impact. “It was about the culture we wanted to create here,” Andreessen added,” something that anyone who aspires to the same goals can see.” We’ll see which other firms also make this move. I brought up the for-profit school of thought. “It’s true that there’s a lot of value created for society by these companies,” Horowitz responded, “but people outside of high tech make huge contributions to it — teachers at local schools, police… it’s broad. But the way money works it that most of it goes to people like us. We think by giving back, we keep the ecosystem going in a positive way.” Andreessen seconded the role of philanthropy in capitalism. “It’s a great American tradition. We’re one of the most capitalist of the advanced countries, with job creation and destruction at four times the rate of most European countries. And for the last 150 to 200 years, a lot of the most successful people in capitalism have giving back. Even some of the limited partners in our fund are philanthropic organizations created 100 years ago by entrepreneurs who were extremely successful –and sometimes ruthless. Silicon Valley itself was based on Stanford, a university created by a ‘robber baron.'” The first parcel of money will go towards six local charities below: * Ben and Felicia Horowitz: Via Rehabilitation * Jeff and Karen Jordan: Ecumenical Hunger Program * John O’Farrell and Gloria Principe: Second Harvest Food Bank * Marc and Laura Andreessen: Fresh Lifelines for Youth * Peter and Martha Levine: Canopy * Scott and Pamela Weiss: The Shelter Network [Image of Andreessen and Horowitz via Forbes .]

"Tales From A Tesla Model S At 200K Miles

Tesloop’s first vehicle, a Tesla Model S they put into service in July 2015, has reached a new milestone: 200,000 miles on the odometer. Tesloop, you’ll recall, ferries passengers between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in electric Tesla vehicles, making it easy to rack up that many miles in a year. Not many electric cars of any make or model have reached this kind of mileage, so I was curious to find out how the Tesla is holding up. I called Rahul Sonnad at Tesloop, who noted that these were nearly all highway miles, and the Model S was in Auto Pilot mode most of that time. According to Tesla, city vs. highway miles aren’t such a big deal in electric cars, but it’s worth mentioning. “We did have a few things go wrong,” Sonnad said. At about 30,000 miles, the car was relaying messages to Tesla HQ that the motor was operating at low power. “Tesla called us up and told us that,” Sonnad said. “We didn’t notice any problems. It was super fast.” But Tesla had the company bring the car in, and it replaced the front motor. The bigger issue, and the bigger question that everybody asks about, according to Sonnad, is battery degradation. That was my question too. The Tesloop Model S has only degraded about 6%, even though it’s being charged to 100% every day, rather than the default—and recommended—90% charge. “For your daily driver, you don’t fully charge unless you’re doing a long trip,” Sonnad said. “We’re doing a long trip every day. We save, like, three minutes in charging in Barstow if we fully charge beforehand. We decided that we’re gonna suck it up, fully charge, and let it degrade. We figured that if it degraded enough, we could take it off a Vegas route and put it on a local Orange County route.” Then, just as the car hit 200,000 miles, the range estimator became inaccurate. Though the car didn’t actually lose any range, the estimator would say it could go another ten miles—and then power down. Tesla looked into the issue, and told Tesloop that there’s a battery chemistry state that high-mileage cars go into, and the software isn’t properly compensating for that change. There will be a firmware update in three months that will take care of the discrepancy, but Tesla just replaced the battery to solve the problem. “We got our 6% range back with the new battery,” Sonnad said with a laugh. “But had the firmware been updated, we’d be fine and plugging along.” Tesloop has paid to replace the car’s 12-volt battery for $190, and it buys sets of off-the-shelf 40,000-mile Goodyear tires pretty regularly, for a total of about $2,500 in the past year. And those are the only maintenance costs it’s had, thanks to Tesla’s unlimited 8-year warranty. “We haven’t even replaced the brakes,” Sonnad said. I wondered if Tesloop, given how it’s using these cars, has any extra warranty or service deal with Tesla. “It’s nothing special; we’re under the standard warranties and everything,” Sonnad said. “We now have a lot of first-name friends in the service department, and we ask a lot of questions. And the car is in there for various inspections.” He also noted that Tesloop’s car reached this mileage in just a year. It would take most people a decade to drive this many miles, and over that time it’s likely that a bunch of little things will fail. “I buy old cars personally, 20-year old cars, and things don’t work like they should on those cars,” Sonnad said. “There are issues like those that we didn’t encounter in one year, but not any in the drivetrain.”

"Ridemakerz Builds A Virtual World For Boys Filled With Its Toy Cars

Larry Andreini thinks he can take on Pixar.  The founder and CEO of Ridemakerz , a rapidly growing chain of stores where boys can custom-build their own toy cars, is building a virtual world for his 6-to-12-year-old customers and their cars.  This virtual world is in closed beta right now, and will launch early next year. So will Pixar’s World of Cars and startup Webcarzz . There is a gap on the Web between Webkinz and Club Penguin and the more adult social networks of MySpace, Facebook and beyond, particularly for boys.  Other than Pirates of the Carribean Online , there is not much out there yet.  Andreini wants to parlay the loyalty of his customers into a virtual world where they can design and play with the exact same cars they can buy in his stores.  Making that connection between the virtual and the real, even if it’s just a toy, is where he thinks he’ll have a leg up on the competition.  The virtual world he is building is also pretty advanced and goes way beyond being a slick brochure for his products, although it is that as well.  Kids don’t have to buy a car to play in the virtual world, but the experience is better if they do.

"A Day With Glass: First Impressions Of The Early Days Of Google’S Latest Moonshot

As we shared yesterday, the process to actually pay for the Glass Explorer Edition was quite simple . The next step in the process is picking up your device at either the Mountain View, Los Angeles or New York City Google Campus. Of course, you can opt to have them shipped to you if you’re not in one of those areas, but what’s the fun in that? I picked up my Google Glass today in Mountain View and was told only that I would receive a bit of a walkthrough and proper fitting. I want to warn you, this isn’t a review, there won’t be any unboxing videos , you can find the technical specs here and there will be no pass or fail grade on this first iteration of Google Glass. If you buy into the potential for the device, and, more importantly the platform, then you know that this will be a true exploration into what Google has come up with here. Some will see this device as a fad, something that isn’t really “necessary” in today’s world, and others will see this as the beginning of an adventure for users, developers and Google, of course. I tend to lean towards the adventure side, as it’s not fully known what impact Glass will have on society, your day-to-day activities, or the future of technology and hardware. I arrived at the Googleplex and a few members of the Glass team greeted me. It’s been almost a year since Google’s last I/O conference where 2,000 developers signed up to be a part of the Glass Explorer program, and this is naturally the day that they’ve been waiting for. When I sat down to unbox my Glass, I was shown the proper way that they should sit on my face. The glass itself, where the screen is projected, should sit above your right eye and not in front of it. It’s easy to mess around with the nose pads to get the right fit. The second step is to pair your Glass with your device, using the MyGlass app that recently shipped . Since Glass pairs to your phone through Bluetooth, the device is pretty much useless until that’s done. You log into the app using your consumer, not business, Gmail account, and then you’re off to the races once you’ve paired: Something to note, all of these screenshots are coming from the handy “screencast” tool within the MyGlass app. It shows everything that you’re seeing on Glass. You’re paired, account is connected, Wi-Fi or mobile network is chosen, and you’re ready to use Glass. As you swipe your way through some of the screens on the touchpad with your finger, you’ll notice Google Now cards (if you choose to turn them on), a settings screen, and of course, the all-important command screen that pops up after you say the magic phrase “Ok Glass.” With these voice commands, you can Google things, find directions, send someone a message shoot a video or take a picture. There’s also a button on the top of Glass that lets you snap photos and shoot video as well. The audio, which comes out right by your ear, is crisp and not too loud. The Glass team tells me that looking at the screen takes some time to get used to. Some of the folks who work at Google say it took them up to a week to be able to focus on the screen properly. Let’s be honest, looking up and to the right isn’t a natural movement for our eyes. I’ve found that as I’ve worn them longer, I can glance up pretty quickly and see what I need to see and go back to what I was doing. One trick is to use the screencast function of the app so that you can understand fully where each screen goes and what it does. Let’s start with what Glass isn’t. Glass isn’t a replacement for your cell phone, since you have to pair the device with the one you have for cellular functionality. It’s not a device for watching movies or YouTube videos and it’s not going to replace your computer. You won’t be able to read full search results on the tiny screen, but you’ll be able to get to really relevant information quickly. What Glass seems to be, in the few hours that I’ve spent with it, is a device that picks up some of the things you do throughout your day and makes that information more easily accessible. Currently, the only built-in integration for a third-party service is Path. For example, how many times a day do you pick up your phone to check the time or to see if you have any missed calls or text messages? I couldn’t count the times that I’ve wasted that arm motion, in the sense that it has taken attention away from things around me. Every single time you take your phone out, you’re telling the people that are around you that you have no interest in interacting with them for at least 30 seconds while you dive into your phone. Now, am I saying that having a screen above your eye is any less socially awkward? No. But it lets you access the same information quicker without having to stop what you’re doing. If you look at Glass in its existing state, it’s quite impressive that all of this was fit into a tiny package that sits on your face. Will I get weird stares for a while when I’m out wearing them? Probably. Do I care? Not really. But I do care how it affects others, and that’s something that nobody will be able to talk about for sure until these things are in the wild for a few weeks. Now mind you, this is the Explorer Edition of Glass, and it comes with the barest bones of “apps.” The real magic is going to be what developers start building on the platform. This is where things get really interesting. As we covered last week, there are already investors that are chomping at the bit to put money into developers who are building apps on top of Glass. The possibilities are actually quite endless, starting from potential uses in hospitals for doctors to a new way for teachers to interact with their students. As far as how we interact with the world around us, being able to take pictures from our own vantage point, without setting up a shot for perfect light or shade, is something that has yet to be uncovered. Glass can do that. Being able to join a Google+ Hangout and talk to your friends with nothing more than a device that sits on your nose is pretty cool, too. It all goes back to the developers, though. They have the minds to push Glass forward as not just a geeky novelty, but as a platform to enhance our lives. I’m not going to sugarcoat it — this product has a lot of bumpy roads ahead of it. We have to assume that there are developers who can come up with big ideas, that consumers are ready for it and whether it can be at a price point that middle-America can afford. In its current developer-only state, it’s not that hard to grasp how to use it once you get past having something new on your face. This is only a first step, and it’s going to be an interesting ride. Not only can I not wait to build my hands-free recipe app, I’m looking forward to speaking with developers who are forward-thinking enough to see Glass for what it is — not a futuristic gadget, but something that can help us explore the world in a new way. It’s going to take time, though. I mean, even my dog thinks it’s weird: If you’re a developer who is working on, thinking about or are interested in building Glass apps, feel free to reach out to me , as we tell the story of the platform together.

"Gurgle Launches With Mothercare Backing

Gurgle , a social network for parents launches today as a joint venture between retailer Mothercare and MediaBurn, an agency specialising in social networking sites. The site aims to bring together expert information together with social networking tools for parents and parents-to-be. At launch i is offering about 1,000 articles, 52 exclusively commissioned tutorial videos and a number of baby and pregnancy tools. Parents register then Gurgle offers each member a personalised site with relevant articles, videos, groups, people, chat and answers based on each member’s location and the stage of their child’s development. The site’s social functionality can be tailored so mums can talk to their peers in their local area, or to others at the same stage of their pregnancy or child’s development. That’s all very well, but although Mothercare seems to think it has stumbled upon the fact that new parents desire an online community, it’s entering the game a little late. Despite it’s Web 1.0 appearance Mumsnet is still the one to beat in this area, not to mention the plethora of other long-in-the tooth sites in the UK around this area. Gurgle is going to have to work hard to bring anything new, and if the brand is smothered all over the site like a cheap suit parents will smell a rat and click away.

"Demandbase Raises $8 Million For Online Lead Generation Platform

Demandbase , a company involved with B2B sales leads, has raised $8 million in a funding round led by Sigma Partners, Adobe Systems, and Altos Ventures.  In conjunction with the funding round, Demandbase is also releasing “Demandbase Central”, a platform integrating data from across the web and various databases that will be used to power some of the company’s online services. The first two of these offerings, also announced today, are Demandbase Direct and Demandbase Stream.  “Direct” allows users to manage their leads through a web interface and have them automatically distributed to their email or CRMs.  “Stream” allows users to monitor passive visitors to their site and generate sales leads by analyzing incoming traffic.  Demandbase says that Stream will allow companies to capitalize on the “98% of unrealized passive Web traffic” by allowing them to directly target specific visitors (Stream’s success will likely hinge on the company’s ability to accurately identify this incoming traffic). Demandbase is notable for its pay-as-you-go services plans (as opposed to a standard subscription service).

"How Robots Filmed Hollywood'S Latest Blockbuster, 'Gravity'

 Editor’s note: When we first published this story in December, 2012, we weren’t allowed to mention the name of the movie. Now that Gravity is out, the truth can be told.  Hollywood’s latest blockbuster Gravity was filmed by robots. Four giant industrial robots whisked props, lights and even actors around the set in a ballet of split-second precision, as well as doing the camerawork. They call it cinematic automation.  “We are taking a movie set and thinking about it like a manufacturing facility,” says Jeff Linnell, co-founder of Bot&Dolly .  Bot&Dolly bought three second-hand industrial robots back in 2008. “I had been wondering for years why people weren’t using them to move cameras around,” says Linnell. He ran a small advertising and video production company in San Francisco and had spent his career doing motion graphics and animation. “The first robot found its way into a Louis Vuitton TV commercial a week later.”  Some time later, Linnell got a call from a Warner Brothers executive who said the studio was shooting a new movie called Gravity .  “It has a lot of impossible shots which you would not be able to do with traditional wire work and is massively ambitious technically,” explains Linnell. It took a year and a half to write a new control system for the robots that could be used on the set.   Robots were used in film-making as far back as Star Wars, but they were always custom-built and required proprietary software and a highly-specialized human operator. In the 1980s the computer conquered Hollywood, movies went digital, and robots faded into the background.  Bot&Dolly’s founders felt that everything that could be done on a computer had already been done and that it was time to get film-makers back into the real world. So they took Autodesk’s Maya animation software (the industry standard) and wrote tools to allow non-robotics exeprts — like animators — to run robots using the software they were already familiar with.  “Animators were flying cameras around in the virtual world doing Avatar or whatever but they never had the power to be film-makers,” says Linnell. “Now the same animators can move a camera around, or an actor or a prop. Anyone from Pixar can pick up the tool that they use every day, hit an export button and animate a robot.”  Bot&Dolly’s software system controls some standard robots like Scout and Iris, which weigh from 6 up to 500 kilograms, but users can also control their own robots by adding a new model to the software.  Robots can achieve a level of precision, speed and coordination of movement which cannot be matched by humans. “If you want to move a coffee cup six inches across a table at two meters per second and have it stop on a dime, we want to give you a tool to do that without hiring a developer.” Lights, props, explosions, special effects, and even the positions of the actors — all can be synchronized to the millisecond and coordinated with sound and playback.  Industrial robots don’t usually work in such close proximity with people, so safety was a critical issue, especially when those people are expensive movie stars like George Clooney. The system contains checks and safeguards to ensure the robots are on the programmed flight path and uses laser tripwires, pressure mats and other technology to keep track of the humans. High-risk shots are rehearsed at various speeds, building up to real-time.  Bot&Dolly’s robots have also developed showbiz careers of their own. They have appeared in advertisments for Google and star in a Las Vegas show where they act and play music with the Blue Man group.  “People are pretty fascinated by large robots,” says Linnell. “When they move in a highly coordinated way where all the axes are moving at the same time, the movement is incredibly organic and snake-like. It’s a bit disconcerting and amazing even to myself having watched these things for years now. In a theatrical production, we are trying to give them a sense of character, purposely making them sad or proud or scared. You can convey emotion quite easily.”  The next generation of stars may be built, not born.

"Mysterious Swiveling Acer Phone Sighted

It’s Just a couple weeks before the 2009 Mobile World Congress kicks off in Barcelona. Thus, a flurry of leaked mobile devices continues to grow, day by day. In today’s pre-release news, BGR has got his hands on a crystal clear image of an unidentified Acer smartphone.  All that can be gathered from the shot is that it has a strange swiveling QWERTY key pad. Is it just me, or is it really unclear how the two halves will slide back together? Oh, and it has a touch screen (duh) and it’s not clear whether it will run on WinMo, Android, or some other funky fresh OS.  Keep your eyes peeled, kids!

"Sfo Serves Cease-And-Desist Letters To Keep Ride-Sharing Companies From Operating At The Airport

Last week, InstantCab announced to the world that it had received a partial cease-and-desist letter from the San Francisco International Airport , asking it to stop picking up and dropping off passengers there. Well, apparently it wasn’t alone, as other new transportation startups had also received the same notice last month. SideCar, for instance, confirmed that it received a cease-and-desist letter in early March. Zimride’s Lyft hasn’t responded to our inquiries, but we’ve heard that it too was one of the companies hit with a C&D notice. InstantCab, which operates a hybrid service with both community and taxi drivers, was actually the last of the companies to be served with a notice by SFO. And that notice applied to its community drivers only, not the taxi e-hail side of its business. The letters served to remind companies like Lyft and SideCar that the site is operated by the City and County of San Francisco and the Airport Commission, and also as a reminder that they didn’t have permits to operate on SFO premises. Without a permit, the notices say that continued operation of community driver services at SFO will be considered “an unlawful trespass.” In particular, the notice says those services are violating a couple of airport rules and regulations, including this one: Like every other airport in the world, SFO allows regulated taxi services to pick up and drop off passengers on the premises. Black car and limo services have been driving passengers to and from SFO for decades. And over the past few years, Uber has even provided a transportation alternative to those flying in and out of the airport — although Uber drivers are mostly indistinguishable from limo services, in part because the company partners with them for its UberBLACK and UberSUV service. The key distinguishing feature of the services hit by cease-and-desist letters by SFO seems to be that they employ community drivers who are not licensed by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency or the California Public Utilities Commission. In that respect, SFO isn’t the first to try to outlaw these services. Lyft and SideCar (along with Uber and Tickengo) had all received C&D notices from the CPUC last year before the agency backtracked and began examining the possibility of creating a new regulatory framework for ride-sharing services . And SideCar has received some pushback from local regulators in markets, such as Philadelphia and Austin, cities it recently expanded into. The wild card here is Uber, which to our knowledge hasn’t yet received notice from SFO. While it’s quietly served the airport’s passengers since launching in San Francisco years ago, it recently joined the ride-sharing brigade by contracting community drivers for its lower-priced UBERx service.

"Bolt Hosed, Shows The Risks Of Video

 GoFish , a video-sharing site much like YouTube, has acquired another video site, Bolt , to save that company from lawsuits that threatened to sink it.  The $30 million transaction, first reported by the NYT , is reportedly being used by New York’s Bolt to pay a settlement of “several million dollars” to Universal Music Group, which had sued Bolt for copyright infringement. (See merger filing here )  Thus ends the topsy-turvy ride of Bolt, the company started in 1996 to target teenagers, and once backed by investors like Highland Capital, America Online, and Oak Investment with more than $66 million. It had even filed to go public in December 1999, with only $4 million in revenue and no profit — just as the dot-com meltdown began. It was forced to pull its IPO.  So co-founder and chief exec Aaron Cohen and co-founder Lou Kerner bought the company back from investors in 2004. Which is why Cohen tells the Times: “This deal is economically painful to Bolt shareholders…It is setting a precedent that companies that violate copyright at minimum risk litigation.”  Bolt apparently had revenue of $7 million by the end of last year. It had 5.3 million users in the U.S, according to ComScore Media Metrix.  GoFish, a two year old San Francisco company, went public last year through a reverse merger, so called because it merged with company that was already publicly traded but had no operations. GoFish has little, if any revenue , but has a market value of $134 million. GoFish.com had 1.4 million users in December.  Cohen and Bolt president Jay Gould are now involved with a project, called WikiYou , which has received seed funding from First Round Capital and Mayfield Fund, reports NewTeeVee .

"Watch As Valve Shows How The Unorthodox Steam Controller Works With Portal And Civ

 Two weeks ago, Valve revealed its Steam Controller to close out a trio of announcements that also saw the company lift the veil on its SteamOS operating system and Steam Machine PC consoles . Now, Valve is finally showing us all exactly how the weird, touchpad-based controller works.  Valve just released a video that shows how the Steam Controller deals with a variety of different games. In the clip, one of the controller’s creators used the device to play first-person puzzler Portal 2, turn-based strategy game Civilization V, first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and the point-and-click adventure Papers, Please. From the video, it doesn’t seems like Valve’s engineer has any issues playing these very different games using the new hardware.  Check it out for yourself below:   The Steam Controller is fully configurable. Players can even adjust the trackpads independently. That means one of the inputs can act like a mouse and the other can act like a keyboard’s WASD keys. The Counter-Strike clip even proves that the trackpads can handle precise movements.  This video should help gamers to get a better understanding of the Steam Controller, but it is still likely one of those scenarios where the majority of people are going to need to use it for themselves before knowing how to feel about it.

"Innovate2016: Libertarian Presidential Candidate Says “We Need To Uber Everything”

 Given the unprecedented unpopularity of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, 2016 could well be the year of the third party candidate. Whatever one thinks of his ideology, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson may be the pro innovation candidate that Silicon Valley has been waiting for. We need “to Uber everything” Johnson tells INNOVATE2016 guest interviewer CALinnovates’ Kish Rajan . The sharing economy, he believes, is the “model of the future” and should be encouraged, rather than regulated against. It’s “so short-sighted” of local authorities, he insists, citing his problems in trying to rent his own property, to outlaw Airbnb. If I’m President, the 2016 Presidential candidate promises, “we’ll stop with the restriction.” Johnson may also be more in sync with Silicon Valley on both surveillance and immigration. The mass collection by the government of our personal data, he argues, has been pointless. He is equally outspoken on immigration, saying that “we are a country of immigrants” and we should “embrace immigration” by getting government out of the business of establishing quotas. So no walls for Gary Johnson. It’s going to be interesting to see how this radical pro innovation message plays out in 2016.

"Apple Acquires Another Machine Learning Company: Tuplejump

Apple is on a machine learning company buying spree. After buying Perceptio at the end of 2015 and Turi just a few months ago , Apple has now acquired an India/US-based machine learning team, Tuplejump. We’d been hearing rumors of another acquisition in this space by Apple for some time. While Apple won’t outright confirm it, when asked about Tuplejump this morning, a representative from Apple gave us the company’s standard we’re-not-saying-yes-but-well-yes response that they only give when they have, in fact, bought the company in question: Haven’t heard of Tuplejump? That’s okay — as with most machine learning companies, they’re not exactly a household name (unless you’ve got a data scientist in your house, I guess.) Tuplejump’s website has been taken down following the acquisition, but a Wayback Machine capture of its about page has the company describing itself thusly: Terms of the deal are not yet known. We’re hearing that Apple was particularly interested in “FiloDB”, an opensource project that Tuplejump was building to efficiently apply machine learning concepts and analytics to massive amounts of complex data right as it streamed in. According to its github page , FiloDB was primarily headed up by Evan Chan; Chan’s LinkedIn page says he’s been with Tuplejump since August of 2015. But will FiloDB live on as an opensource project? It seems like it — it’s recently been pushed to its own repository (whereas it previously lived under Tuplejump’s account) and newly committed code has been pulled into the project within the last few weeks.

"The Art Of Raising Seed: You’Re Either Hot, Or You Make Your Own Heat

Editor’s note: This post is written by guest author Darius “Bubs” Monsef , who is founder & CEO of the new design marketplace CreativeMarket . He is also the founder of the popular creative community COLOURlovers and is a mentor with 500Startups & PIEPDX. Bubs blogs at HelloBubs . I’d started raising 3 rounds. One fell apart and the others raised $1M & $1.3M in a few weeks each. The startup game is a marathon and while I’m not yet qualified to give advice about crossing the finish line, I feel like I know a lot about the first 5 miles… It’s from that perspective I give the following advice to fellow founders who are looking to raise their seed rounds. I learned a ton when the first round fell apart. We didn’t need it, which is why it fell apart… but the interactions & lessons learned were invaluable in us later successfully raising two rounds. When we set out to do our first, we had just completed YC and were bootstrap profitable. We had some ideas of where to take the business, but they were largely influenced by what we thought investors would want to hear. That didn’t sit well with us and made my pitch less impassioned. And we weren’t sure we wanted to raise… So I took meetings and got some interest from investors, but those meetings were scattered over the course of a few weeks. (We were dealing with an acquisition offer at the same time, so my full energy wasn’t in raising.) As weeks went on, investors that were interested and had given us verbal commitments started taking longer to respond to emails and some were never heard from again. You could feel things going cold. After we closed that big partnership deal, I proactively shut down the round. I reached back out to investors to tell them we had some capital to take us further down the road and that we would circle back later on. I wanted to shut it down from a position of strength instead of letting it fizzle out. There’s a lot more to say, though. Below are the lessons I’ve learned. I hope they help you raise your rounds. Let me first be very clear: This isn’t about lying or being dishonest. It’s about preparing yourself and your strategy for a key time in your startup’s life. The same way you should optimize a landing page for conversions, you should optimize your pitching for conversions. It’s a lot like dating. Attraction matters. And you can’t just Photoshop your Match.com photo for your seed round. You’re going to have to meet people in person, so make sure the person you present in your deck is the person you are… the best version of who you are. I heard advice once from a fellow founder that agreed that manufacturing heat is important, but he took it further and said something to the effect of… “Take meetings just to cancel them.” That kind of move can work for some people, but that’s not how I roll and in my opinion you don’t want to start any kind of relationship by being dishonest. If you can’t raise your round without lying & trickery, then maybe you should reevaluate what you’re trying to do. Some founders are lucky to bathe in the light of hype. They raise big rounds fast. The rest of us, however, have to really work at it. When my company is in fundraising mode I’m dedicated to that 100% of the time. My team knows I’m not on product or other biz dev tasks. For a solo-founder company or one where the person pitching investors is also the sole developer, this can be a big drag. But you can’t half-ass making heat and without the heat you probably won’t raise your round. The moment you tell anybody you’re raising a round, the clock starts ticking. The longer it takes you to close your round, the less likely it will actually happen. If you’re hot you should be able to get interest and close a round pretty quickly. If you’re still dragging ass two months in, things can get cold and often freeze up. An honestly packed schedule forces you to be busy and appears less desperate. “I can talk to you anytime this week” sounds like nobody else is interested. “I can talk to you at 1pm on Wed or 3pm on Thurs” sounds like your schedule is full (and it really should be). “My schedule is pretty full, but I really want to connect and will move things around” is your first line if the meeting is really important. So, don’t say you’re raising until you’re really ready. Here’s how you’ll know: – You have an early commitment. – You have your list of 30-50 investors in a spreadsheet ready to work. – You have intro requests queued up from 3-5 people for each investor you don’t know. – You have your calendar cleared for the next 4 weeks of intensive fundraising. Now go. It might not make sense to have an early commitment before you start raising, but it’s hugely helpful. Flex your networks and figure out what investors you have the best relationships with. If you don’t, then start working on it now. And don’t stop. Months before we started raising our first successful round I thought a lot about who we could get in early and how we’d round it out. I’d met Dave McClure a few times and thought he and his newly created 500Startups would be a good fit. So I reached out to offer my help as a mentor in design & community for 500Startups. And for a couple months I added value and got to know him. I also knew Alexis Ohanian and had talked to him a few times about our personal alignment around our philanthropic work. Then when I knew we were getting ready to raise, I approached Dave and Alexis about being in our round. Remember to get verbal commitments for the round before you start. Let’s be clear, not everyone may be able to get a verbal commit before they actually start publicly raising and in that scenario, what you should do is front-load your calendar with the meetings that will most likely convert. Start with the investors who most understand your product and market fit. Or the investors that are capable of making split decisions (i.e., Angels, not VCs.) and those you have the strongest ties to. If you’re lucky enough to have family or friends or anyone willing to invest early on, it’s super helpful in being able to approach early investors and tell them “we just started taking meetings about our round and already have $50-100k committed.” Investors, especially the great ones have what’s called ‘deal flow’. They’ve see a ton of deals. In order to be able to get through checking out every opportunity, they look for patterns. They look for things they’ve seen in other successful companies… Harvard, MIT, Stanford educations… Google, Apple, Facebook former employee… up and to the right graphs… Every abnormality from these patterns, though, is a negative mark for you. But, this doesn’t mean your deal is dead, it just means you need to position yourself where your strengths are. If you have the pedigree, put it out front; if you don’t but have traction, put that out front. I went out to raise a seed round for a color website… at a time when game mechanics & social analytics were all the rage. There is now a design renaissance that makes us more appealing as a pattern match because of the success of both Pinterest and Fab. I didn’t graduate from a great school with a CS degree… I didn’t graduate at all. None of our founders have a CS degree. (We’re all self-taught.) In fact, I was recruited by Microsoft and went through YC, so that’s what helps qualify us to investors. But what we have to show for our team is a track record of building great product and growing passionate communities. So… My team bio slide is not first in our deck. This is: I’ve talked to lots of entrepreneurs that think they want to raise $200k or $300k. But these are abnormal amounts for legit seed rounds. Again, when hot startups are all raising seed rounds of $750k-$1.5M and you say you’re raising $200k, it’s not a good look. Investors don’t hear “we’re smart & capital efficient” they hear “this is a small idea and we don’t need much money because their isn’t a big opportunity to go after.” So, set a realistic target round size and then try and get oversubscribed. You’d rather be in a position where you have more interest in your round than room to fit investors in. This gives you the option of raising more, or being selective about what investors you really think are the best fit for you. For our seed round we set out with a target of $750k and ended up raising a million. We had some great investors that we wanted to fit in, and the difference between raising the extra $250k was only a couple points of equity. Again, this isn’t about being tricky and or dishonest. I know a lot of investors that are pretty annoyed at how much founders are pushing the whole oversubscribed thing. For any investor who takes the time to get interested in you and evaluate your deal… to get pushed out because you were just talking to them to inflate interest is a pretty shitty move. Shoot for a reasonable target, and if you’re not able to get enough interest to close the higher amount, at least you’ve set an amount you know you can close. If you went out to close a $1M round and got stalled out around $800k, it can be a painful road to get that last $200k. At that point you’re not hot. You’re desperate to close and that sends all the wrong signals. Also, make sure you really are raising enough. Push for explosive growth, but assume a slow rise. “Seeing seed funded startups that raise less than $750K have a very high rate of mortality. Not sure if its correlated or causative.” @georgezachary Be careful about your advisors. People often like to have big amazing advisory boards… but if any of your advisors are also investors (who aren’t investing in you) it sends up a big red flag. Paul Graham once told me that an advisor is an investor that doesn’t believe in you enough to put cash in. To be fair this isn’t true of all advisors. I advise a couple startups about early stage design & community building stuff… but I’m not investing right now, so there is no conflict. When you have a known investor as an advisor but who doesn’t have some skin in it, other investors are going to take that as a bad sign. So either get your advisors to invest some cash or don’t count them as an advisor. One thing that bothers me about Silicon Valley is how people talk about how they’re doing. Even in friendly conversations rarely do people say anything negative… even when things are on flames and 10 feet from crashing into the ground. This is because the startup world is small. Way smaller than you think. I try to be a pretty direct and honest person, when things are bumpy I’ll tell you about it. I’m confident about what we’re doing and humble enough to ask for help when I think people are smarter than me. But this has come back to bite me in the ass more than once. When we were first out of YC talking to investors, a prominent investor who was friendly with us suggested we talk to one of his buddies who also ran a thriving community site. So we met this other founder for beers and what I thought was just hanging out. We talked about our startups, ideas, random thoughts about opportunities, etc. It was just a few founders out for drinks and shooting the shit. But it really wasn’t. What was communicated back to that investor was that we didn’t know what we were doing. That we had a scattering of ideas and weren’t confident. And that investor, although he had verbally committed to be in our round backed out. Causing the round to fall apart. In a world where everybody says things like “awesome, dude. growth is amazing and the team is killer.” It’s not a good look when you say something less confident and that apparent lack of confidence is often the only thing that is heard. So when you’re raising, and sometimes you’re always raising. Be careful about what you say and to who. This world is small and everybody knows everybody else. Just assume whatever you say is going to get to the ear of an investor. Not sure I need to point this out again, but this isn’t about lying. Just find a way to see and talk about what’s in your glass… even if it isn’t half full and closer to only a drop left in it. I don’t have a strong opinion on this. Both rounds I’ve raised were done as notes, but I would have been fine doing series seed docs. As a founder with hundreds of things on my brain, the conversion details of the note are just one more thing to have knocking around versus the clear cap table of a series seed round. I think you can also have series seed docs that are just as friendly to founders as notes but notes can be cheaper and quicker to get done. Pitch decks are almost required for raising a round, but they don’t have to be a required part of your pitch. I’m good in conversation and presenting to small groups, so I’d prefer to have a conversation as opposed to doing the pitch dance. The risk in presenting your deck is that your pitch has to be perfect for any investor. You can say one word about your market that can derail the whole rest of your conversation and it’s hard to course correct when it’s written right there in your slide. During my first round I started getting my laptop set-up to pitch an investor but by the end, my laptop stayed in my bag until I needed to demo something. My pitch deck was really only sent out as a reference tool for partners. There is also caution in letting your deck speak for you. Even if you’re the best slide crafter in the universe, it’s hard to get 10 slides to be more passionate, inspiring and intelligent than you are. So don’t send your deck out with your cold emails. I only send it out after I’ve spoken to somebody, or if a lead is already really hot and just needs some reference points. My decks are also purposefully not great without me there to weave the story. They’re just a few words on a slide, or a graph, or a picture. I don’t want my deck to tell my story. I want to tell it in my voice. But if you’re a bit shy or don’t freestyle conversation that well, using a deck to help you tell your story is fine. Like with all founder advice use what works well for you, and don’t worry about the rest. We got early verbal commits from well known and respected investors BEFORE we started raising. (Don’t tell Dave McClure I said he was respectable. That would ruin his image.) We agreed to terms with Dave and then went out to raise. (Note about terms. The valuations that companies are raising right now are pretty crazy. If you’re lucky to be a YC company your valuation can be close to $10M. For a brand new idea this seems a bit nuts to me… but hey, if you can get it, good for you. We had an established site, millions of users and we raised our first round at a $5M cap. Although we could have raised at a higher valuation, we prioritized investors over a higher cap. The dilution wasn’t substantially different but we ended up with the investors we wanted to and not just the ones who would accept different terms. Do your own math and figure out what’s right for you.) With our terms set, we put our profile up on Angel.co and they blasted us out to a thousand investors. Because of our advisors & early commitments, we got 25 inbound requested intros and that interest created heat. Enough heat to push our inbound intros to about 65 in the first week or so. (An Angel.co record at the time.) Then I packed 60 meetings into the next couple weeks. Often with 8+ a day. I’m not a bullshitter and I hate sales-y jargon and when a potential investor was giving me grief or not understanding the opportunity, I simply said,  “No worries, I appreciate your time” and quickly removed them from my target list. When you have 50 other meetings to take, you can rebound immediately from a crap meeting. When you only have 3 scheduled and take a downer… it’s hard to get back up. From those 65+ intros we ended up closing a round with about 10 investors. Some large VCs, some growing syndicates and some small angel founders that I respect a lot. I’ve technically tried to raise four rounds but I really can’t count the first. It was 5 years ago before I knew anything about startups. I lobbed a couple cold emails into top tier VCs and hoped to talked to them. They didn’t get back to me. Nowadays there are amazing resources like Angel.co (who I credit with largely helping us raise our first round) and CrunchBase (where I go to see who’s invested in who when compiling my target lists). I’m just one of hundreds of founders who’ve raised a round but feel free to ask for help. Need help putting your deck together? Want an intro to an investor? Want advice about terms / round size? Ask us. We’re busy, but I think most of us are willing to carve out a bit of time to help a fellow founder getting started. All the best. Build great companies and change the world. Let me know if I can help you.

"Congressman Uses Gaming Forum To Help Gather Anti-Sopa Support

 Congressman Jared Polis made an impromptu appearance on the official forum for online game League of Legends yesterday, to help gather further support in the movement against the Stop Internet Piracy Act (SOPA).  Congressman Polis, Democratic Representative from Colorado, plays League of Legends himself, and his message was met with a wealth of positive responses from fellow gamers.  The controversial SOPA bill is aimed at giving the U.S. government and copyright holders the authority to seek court orders against websites associated with infringing, pirating or counterfeiting intellectual property. Critics of the bill say that it will curb creativity, cost jobs and jeopardize free speech.  Riot Games CEO Brandon Beck had appealed to League of Legends players to write to Congress, in order to help stop the bill being passed. Polis then made his appearance in the same forum thread, to highlight the reasons he feels that SOPA should be stopped:  Hi, this is Congressman Jared Polis of Colorado. As a member of the League of Legends community (partial to Anivia and Maokai), and as someone who made his living as an Internet entrepreneur before being elected to Congress, I’m greatly concerned about the future of the Internet and gaming if Congress doesn’t wake up. You may have heard that Congress is currently considering a bill called the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA. While SOPA has a ton of problems, there are some significant issues that I thought fellow gamers might want to know about.  I’m particularly concerned that SOPA might stifle the kind of innovation that brings us games we love, such as LoL. The bill makes it far too easy for angry competitors to sue good law abiding companies out of existence. It threatens any company or website that depends on user-generated content, even companies like Riot. Instead of coming up with great ways to keep making games like LoL even better, companies will have to spend their money hiring lawyers. That’s why companies like Riot, who want to protect the games they create, are opposed to SOPA.  I’ve been working on alternative legislation that would protect the games companies create while also fostering innovation. But we also need you to call your members of Congress and let them know of your opposition to SOPA. This bill has a very real chance of passing, and it is up to all of who want to protect the Internet to take action. More information is available at http://keepthewebopen.com/ . Please make your voices heard in this debate! I will be happy to respond to your posts below, and will check back every few hours today and respond to as many as I can.  True to his word, Polis did check back on the site, to see the comment “We need more representatives like you”, to which he replied “*blush* There are a few who get this, but your calls will help convince many representatives who haven’t decided yet on this. Jared.”  Congressman Polis even found time to joke about his customized ‘United States Congress’ avatar with forum member ‘bieberfever123’:  bieberfever123 : WHY DOES HE GET AN AVATAR AND l DONT???  Rep Jared Polis : u would just use Justin Beiber as your avatar anyway  bieberfever123 : You got a problem with that?  Rep Jared Polis : Jes saying it might b a copyright violation  Polis, who formed a number of successful internet businesses, including ProFlowers.com , before being elected to Congress in 2008, has been a vocal opponent of the SOPA bill. He has previously said that SOPA will “destroy the Internet as we know it” , and is instead backing an alternative bill, known as OPEN: Online Protection & Enforcement of Digital Trade Act.  To keep up to date with the SOPA story, be sure to follow VentureBeat’s ongoing coverage .

"Google Wallet’S Huge Upgrade Adds Support For All Credit/Debit Cards, Remote Disable Feature

Of all the limitations that Google’s NFC-based Wallet payment system had, perhaps the biggest was that of card compatibility — once you blew through that free $10 credit, it only ever worked well if you owned a CitiBank MasterCard. Note the use of the past tense in that sentence. Google recently revealed a substantial update to the Wallet service that allows it to (finally) play nice with Visa, Discover, and American Express credit or debit cards. It’s all thanks to a dramatic change in how Google Wallet handles users’ credit and debit card information — Google Wallet product manager Robin Dua explains it like so: That’s not all Google has been working on — also on deck is a new remote wipe feature that allows users to reset the Wallet app and purge all related financial data right from the service’s online management site. While the update has effectively opened up the service to scores of new users, Google Wallet still has a ways to go before it becomes as ubiquitous as Google likely wants it to be. A quick look at the list of supported devices highlights nicely how much headway Google has to make — there are only eight devices listed, and all but two of them (the unlocked Galaxy Nexus and the Nexus 7, naturally) are tied up with Sprint. Now that the action has moved to the cloud and secure element issue isn’t really an issue any more, one has to wonder if Verizon customers will finally be able to get in on the NFC payment fun (officially, anyway). The carrier took issue with the app’s use of that secure hardware element, and cited it as a reason why the service wasn’t available for the LTE Galaxy Nexus late last year . Alas, that hurdle doesn’t seem to have been cleared yet — it doesn’t appear in the Play Store while searching on my VZW Galaxy Nexus, and the app (which I installed way back when ) itself still refers to the device as “unsupported.”

"Windows Phone 7 Emulator Hacked. Sweet, Sweet Secrets Spill Out.

As anyone in the history of ever who has ever written a single line of code that might be subject to hacking knows, the only way to keep something “hidden” in an application is to just not include it at all. Sure, you can obfuscate the hell out of it out in the source code, or add some crazy configuration value that enables it; just don’t expect either of those to work for much longer than 5 minutes. Either the WP7 team didn’t get that memo, or they’re perfectly comfortable with people unlocking a bunch of features in the emulator that didn’t come enabled by default. A gent who’s now looking to have his name removed from the project managed to tear apart the ROM included with the WP7 development tools and flip a few switches that shouldn’t necessarily have been switched. Where as the original emulator set up would only show Internet Explorer and a tile or two, the hacked ROM brings out the Live Tiles, Voice Search, and Hubs. Better yet, it shows off a few fancy new features that have never been seen, including a file explorer and a task manager. Pocketnow has a nice little write-up on how to get the hacked ROM up and running in your own emulator – but if you’re not feeling too tinkery, check out the shots of the file manager and task manager below.

"Zenefits Just Raised $500 Million At A $4.5 Billion Valuation

Zenefits today said it has raised $500 million in a round led by Fidelity and TPG at a whopping $4.5 billion valuation. The company, which allows small- and medium-sized businesses to manage human resources services in a much simpler fashion, is one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses ever , and in an interview, Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad said the big round was raised to keep the company growing as quickly as it already is. “If you think about it like we’re driving a car, we want to go extremely fast at an extremely high speed, and go very far,” Conrad said. “And if you want to do that you’re gonna burn a lot of gasoline. So this round we had to do the mother of all pit stops for gas and beef jerky, to continue building at the speed that we’re going.” Still, such rapid growth doesn’t come without a cost. Our sources previously told us that the company expects to lose more than $100 million in 2015, which dwarfs the amount of money it burned through in 2014. Raising venture capital financing is an important way to shore up against those losses and still sustain the incredibly rapid growth a company like Zenefits has experienced. The numbers fit in with what we earlier reported , but the notable thing here is that over the course of Zenefits’ most-recent financing process, the valuation has grown by billions. Earlier, we had heard the valuation could be around $3 billion, and that it could go as high as $4 billion. That number apparently went up once again — a sign that interested investors are bidding it up in order to get into one of the most sought-after startups. Like many other modern enterprise services, Zenefits aims to have a much easier onboarding process for payroll and benefits for employees. The company offers its HR services dashboard to employers for free, and makes money by receiving commissions from insurers. Zenefits also said as part of the announcement it has signed up more than 10,000 companies in the U.S. and that it closed more business in March this year than it had in around the first year of its life. Zenefits said it now manages over $700 million in health insurance premiums, as well. The company said it’s on track to hit annual recurring revenue of $100 million by January 2016, and hit $20 million in annual recurring revenue in January this year. Since launching in April 2013, the company has gone to a valuation of $4.5 billion in just about two years. In June last year, the company was valued at $500 million as part of its series B financing round. “The faster you grow, the more capital you burn, because of this dynamic that revenues span over time and the costs are front-loaded,” Conrad said. “If we want to grow that quickly it requires a lot of capital to do the plan that we want to go out and do. Obviously we can grow less quickly and do it on a lot less capital, but we’re in this fortunate position where there are a lot of investors that see our SaaS metrics and say, holy crap this is going to be extremely profitable, all the numbers make a lot of sense.” A lot of that is going to come in the form of headcount, our sources tell us. Last year, the company said it wanted to hire around 1,300 employees over the next three years , and it had around 500 by the end of 2014. Previously we heard that number would quadruple by the end of 2015. Zenefits is well on its way to that, saying that it has around 1,000 employees in the announcement today. The company has also made a number of high-profile hires, including Yammer CEO David Sacks, who joined in December last year . Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Insight Venture Partners, Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures also invested in Zenefits, and previous investors Andreessen Horowitz, IVP and Jared Leto participated, as well. This latest Zenefits round is notable too for making the company Andreessen Horowitz’s largest investment to date. “In my experience, the momentum that Zenefits has achieved in two years is unprecedented. Zenefits has brought the benefits of software to a massive industry that had yet to embrace technology at scale,” said Lars Dalgaard, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a statement. “And their potential market includes tens of millions of employees, using multitudes of different business applications in companies of all sizes. We’re thrilled to have led the A and B rounds and to have doubled down again in the C round.”

"Microsoft: Only 60 Percent Of Xbox 360 Owners Use It To Play Games

Flickr’d Microsoft has sold many Xbox 360 consoles, but apparently only 60 percent of them are used for gaming . The remaining 40 percent of consoles are used for other, just-as-fun things, like watching Netflix and tweeting Opie & Anthony ‘s Bobo sweet nothings . Mhmm. So said a Microsoft exec at a digital entertainment conference. With that in mind, it certainly leads credence to whoever thinks Microsoft, if it wanted to, could become a “big player” in the TV space, à la Google TV. The Xbox 360: Mirosoft’s Trojan Horse. Microsoft also let it be known that there’s 25 million Xbox Live subscribers, but only half of those people have the “real” Xbox Live, Xbox Live Gold.

"Firefox 13 Arrives With New Home Page And New Tab Page, Spdy Support

Most Firefox updates over the last few months were relatively minor. Firefox 13, which is now available for download and which will go out to existing users tomorrow, is a bit different. This update actually introduces a number of consumer-facing updates that finally bring some of Firefox’s features up to par with Google’s Chrome. Most importantly, this new version finally features the long-promised new home and new tab screens. In addition, Firefox now supports the Google-backed SPDY protocol , which promises to significantly improve load times for those sites that support it. Mozilla also made a number of other changes under the hood, including a tweak to how the browser loads restored background tabs. Instead of loading them all when you restart the browser, Firefox now only loads the first tab you see and doesn’t load restored background tabs by default to improve startup speed. You currently have to enable the tab restore feature manually, but it will likely become the default in one of the next versions of Firefox. Most importantly, though, starting up Firefox 13 now drops you in a new home screen, which lets you quickly access and manage your add-ons, settings, download, browsing history and settings. Just like in previous versions, a Google-powered search form takes up most of the screen. When you open a new tab, Firefox 13 now presents you with a Chrome-like thumbnail view of your most visited sites. Just like in Chrome, you can also pin sites you frequently visit to this view and drag bookmarks into it as well. Overall then, this is one of the more interesting Firefox releases in recent months. You can find the release notes with a more detailed overview of all the changes here . The official download links will go live tomorrow, but you can already download a copy of Firefox 13 for Mac and Windows now.

"Dear Amazon Shareholders: Please Wake The Hell Up

 Amazon just concluded yet another rousing earnings call, which it must do as a publicly traded entity to give shareholders  an idea about the health of the business as well as some indication about the success or failure of the company’s business strategy.  Sadly, Amazon deliberately makes these calls as painful as possible, reading off cold numbers from the earnings report and fumbling through analyst questions with answers that contain heavy financial jargon while not actually saying anything useful. All we really know about Amazon’s Q2 2013 is that it lost money instead of earning a profit, spent more on operational costs, and had customers spend more money with them.  The bland financial figures would be fine if Amazon’s entire business was pretty simple … like selling lemonade. But it’s not: The company has various, nontraditional strategies for success — like selling Kindle tablets at cost or its “free shipping” Prime membership service — which presumably are working because Amazon hasn’t gone under. Beyond that, we know nothing.  And yet, Amazon’s stock price closed above $300 per share today and hasn’t dipped much in after-hours trading. Why aren’t shareholders demanding more detailed information? Why aren’t they dumping Amazon as punishment for the company intentionally keeping them in the dark about the health of its business — aka their investment?  It must be because shareholders don’t know what information to demand from Amazon. That said, here’s a few points that would give us some kind of indication about how well the company is actually doing:   How much total revenue did Amazon generate from digital media this quarter (apps, movies, books, TV shows, etc.)?  How many Kindles has Amazon sold (or at least what percentage of growth is Kindle showing)?  How much revenue is Amazon seeing on average from each Kindle owner?  How much did Amazon spend on content licensing?  Are Prime memberships growing? And how much revenue do Prime members generate?  How much is Amazon spending on shipping costs? What’s the outlook for the future?  How are other segments of Amazon’s business doing (Woot, Zappos, IMDb, LoveFilm, etc.)?  Why don’t we have more detailed information about AWS growth?  Seriously, what will you be doing differently to grow the overall business in Q3? (such as expand AmazonFresh into more cities? Produce more original TV shows? etc.)   Pick any five of the above bullet points, and you’d be able to get some sense of how well Amazon is doing. With none of them, you’d pretty much trusting Amazon at its word that things are running smoothly despite missing its earnings guidance for the last three consecutive quarters.

"Salesforce Launches Iot Cloud To Let Business Users Act On Big Data

 Cloud software company Salesforce today is announcing the release of IoT Cloud, a new service that will put the company into a new market. Think of IoT Cloud as a tool that non-technical workers can use to automatically kick off specific actions based on data from Internet-connected devices, social media messages, websites, and other sources.  “We’re really focused on how we can take all the data that’s being generated by all these devices and make it more meaningful to our customers,” Dylan Steele, senior director of product marketing for Salesforce App Cloud, told VentureBeat in an interview.  Of course, IoT Cloud can integrate with Salesforce’s existing services, like the Marketing Cloud and the Service Cloud. Just as IoT can integrate with other entities in the Salesforce portfolio, yesterday Salesforce announced that it’s more tightly integrating the Analytics Cloud with other parts of Salesforce, such as the widely used Sales Cloud customer relationship management (CRM) software.  The broad theme, of course, is that Salesforce is continuing to diversify its offerings and reduce its dependency on the CRM category. That’s why the launch of IoT Cloud is arguably the biggest news to come out of Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference in San Francisco this week. At Dreamforce last year, Salesforce officially unveiled Analytics Cloud , which was a diversifying product itself. The Financial Services Cloud and the Health Cloud represent vertical-specific diversification efforts. Prior to that, there were acquisitions in the marketing category — Buddy Media and ExactTarget — and before that, Salesforce picked up platform as a service (PaaS) cloud capability by buying Heroku .  In this case, Salesforce didn’t buy a company to get the new functionality. IoT Cloud is based on Thunder, an event-processing engine developed at Salesforce, according to a statement.  The software stands out on the basis of not requiring technical expertise. Engineers can write programs that draw on data stored in Hadoop and other repositories, but Salesforce is making this tooling more accessible.  Even so, Salesforce is capitalizing on the continuing marketing buzz around the Internet of Things (IoT), an area where GE and other technology companies have been launching tools and announcing partnerships.  Salesforce is partnering with ARM, Etherios, Informatica, PTC’s ThingWorx, and Xively by LogMeIn for the launch of IoT Cloud.

"How Sony Is Trying To Keep Its Edge With Indie Game Developers (Interview)

 Sony announced last week it has more than 100 games coming from indie game developers for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita consoles.  Adam Boyes, the vice president of publisher and developer relations at Sony’s U.S. game division, said that these are just part of a wave of efforts coming from independent game makers. Sony has more than 1,000 developers licensed for self-publishing on its platforms. So far, Sony’s indies have self-published 21 games on the PS4, including the free-to-play Warframe from Digital Extremes.  We talked to Boyes at Sony’s U.S. game headquarters in San Mateo, Calif. Here’s an edited transcript.  GamesBeat: You didn’t come out and hammer the point, but your momentum seems pretty good.  Adam Boyes: Yes, we’ve been pretty happy so far. To us, it’s sort of the warm-up lap. The race is barely getting started.  GamesBeat: The 21 games that have come out already, were they going as fast as they could? Did you want to space them out in some way?  Boyes: I think all of them chose their own release dates. I don’t believe we influenced any of them. They came out when they wanted to come out.  GamesBeat: With the way the store works now, you don’t have to worry about that?  Boyes: Yeah, they basically set their own release dates.  GamesBeat: Are these numbers better than anything that happened with the PS3 in the past?  Boyes: I don’t think we ever released any numbers for PS3 Plus games. I think we’re just super-happy with 1.8 million downloads for Outlast [a recent survival-horror release on PS4].  GamesBeat: How are you finding indie people? Or are they basically finding you?  Boyes: It’s a mixture. I was just mentioning that at PAX East that we had nine of us going there to just look around. We go to a ton of events. Twitter is the best vehicle for people to reach out to Nick and Brian and Shu. Social media is a great place. They have trailers and videos and stuff. There’s our website, where people can register and reach out that way, too.  Above: Adam Boyes, the VP of publishing and third-parties at Sony Image Credit: Dean Takahashi  GamesBeat: What’s the best way that people are getting noticed?  Boyes: Crazy-new-fresh ideas. That’s the stuff that resonates. When people are playing things and talking about them on Twitter or Facebook. Sharing livestreaming. We talk about Don’t Starve, how with every person who’s streaming, at least 50 people are watching. That’s a great example of how the word’s getting out wider than it ever did before.  In the last generation, if you were playing something, it just shared the name of the game. Now my friends can stream, and I can watch exactly what they do. That’s really powerful.  GamesBeat: With more than 100 game coming, what are you expecting to hit during a certain period of time?  Boyes: We’ve said more than 100 across first-party and third-party this calendar year. There’s no slowdown. It’s going to continue to be a ton of great content.  GamesBeat: And from 1,000-plus developers — what do you notice about the mix there as far as size and so on?  Boyes: There’s quite a few. With us reducing our roadblocks and making it easier, we’re definitely seeing a lot of smaller companies. Less than 10 people — there’s a ton of those now. But it’s been great to see a big mix of developers coming on board.  GamesBeat: Do you see a race going on to grab these people?  Boyes: I think so. Our goal is to continue to evolve the policies and make sure it’s easier, as the months and quarters go by. That’s a big focus for us. The best way to attract them is transparency, accountability, honesty, having a good mutually beneficial relationship. We’re making sure that people play the games and see them.  GamesBeat: There’s evidence that the platform is making them more successful, too.  Boyes: Yeah. We talked about TowerFall on the PS4 outselling the PC version. With Don’t Starve and Outlast being so successful in the instant game collection, that helped boost their sales on other platforms too. In general, there’s just a lot of people that are super hungry for great content.  Above: Galak-Z Image Credit: Sony  GamesBeat: What’s the next level of effort for you, the next milestone you want to reach?  Boyes: For us, there’s no rest. I’m never happy. I want to be able to look these guys in the eye for the next five or 10 years and say, “Are you having a good experience? Is it still as easy as it can be? What else can you help us with?” I talked about the multiple processes we’re doing internally to make things better and easier. We do a lot of surveys during the year to find out how developers are doing with the process, so we can find the things—I’ll never have a flag I want to plant and say, I’m done. Never. How can we can continue to evolve and be more agile?  GamesBeat: Are you using much of your Pub Fund yet?  Boyes: We announced, obviously, Galak-Z and Axiom Verge today. But there’s still quite a bit left. We have a lot of games applying for it. Between that and third-party productions, we have a lot of outlets at our beck and call to be able to — if a developer can’t afford it on their own, we can play with the different programs we have and help them develop for our platform.  GamesBeat: It also helps fill the gap if there’s no triple-A launch happening. It keeps people interested in the meantime.  Boyes: Absolutely. Some people are okay with a couple of months coming between big triple-A launches. What a lot of this content does — Rogue Legacy, I put 60 hours into that. That’s more than I played 100-percenting Tomb Raider. That took me, I think, 40 or 50 hours? I’ve literally played Rogue Legacy on PC [more than Tomb Raider] — even though it’s an indie game, I’ve played it an epic ton. The fact that it’s coming over to our platform — it’s going to create a lot of engagement around great indie content.  GamesBeat: For a while it seemed like there was this fragmentation of platforms. Now it seems like we’re seeing a bit more consolidation among the ones with momentum. Ouya hasn’t done as well as expected. The microconsoles in general aren’t getting a lot of traction. Had they all been successful, there would have been so many platforms out there that the indies might not know where to go to.  Boyes: In general, one of our biggest challenges is that you have to prepare for the future. The future is wide-open. You never know what’s coming. The fact that we’re focused, as a PlayStation brand, on video games — that’s our core focus. It has been since the minute we started talking about PS4. It will be until the end, whenever that is, infinity from now. As long as we’re on top of our game and making our policies better — other challenges will come in. They’ll take their shot. We’ll continue to evolve.  Like I said with that whole flag analogy, I never want to plant it down and say, “Bring it on!” If you’re not always trying to get better, then you’re going to stagnate.  Above: Escape Goat 2 Image Credit: Sony  GamesBeat: One of the Gone Home guys was saying that there’s this rise of super-indies now. You’re starting to see some indie shops that did really well the first time, and now they’re on their second or third project. They’re becoming a force to reckon with and closing in on multimillion-dollar budgets again.  Boyes: I absolutely see that happening. I love all the labels and sublabels. What does “super-indie” mean? Does that mean your first game sold X million units, or made so much, or is it a certain car you drive? Those are important to us, as are the Starwhals of the world.  Transistor and The Witness are bigger-budget, bigger and broader in scale to something more bite-sized that might have taken only four to six months to make. To me it just means that different types of people are going to experience them. It’s not as if one is better or worse than any other. They’re just different.  GamesBeat: That seems to play into the kind of platform that you have, or that you want to have.  Boyes: Yeah. You want something for everyone. It’s like a buffet. You want a little bit of everything. If someone’s a vegetarian or only likes fish, you want a great category for each of those people. Once in a while you might want to have the most amazing filet mignon, and that’s the triple-A $300 million game that comes along as well. It’s about having something for everyone.  GamesBeat: The one-person games are still occasionally becoming hits, too.  Boyes: I think TowerFall’s success has been a great example, with Matt making that game with just a few other people. A lot of games here that have smaller teams — Rogue Legacy I can’t wait for. Spelunky is a super-small team. These are quite successful on the platform. Fez is another good example. It’s done very well on PS4.

"Biggest Domain Sale Of 2013 So Far: $500K For Brand.Com

 In the biggest domain name sale so far this year, MakerBot VP of marketing Chuck Pettis sold Brand.com to Reputation Changer, which has now changed its name — and its brand — to Brand.com .  The sale was leaked earlier , but the exact pricing details had not been released until today.  A half-million dollars sounds like a lot for a domain name, but it’s nothing compared to the $16 million purchase of Insure.com in the heady dot-com bubble days of 2009, or the $14 million price tag on Sex.com. And it’s low compared to what Pettis wanted for the domain — TheDomains.com says that the original sales listing on Website Brokerage requested only seven-figure bids:  ”Only 7 figure (USD) offers will be considered, if your maximum offer is below 7 figures – please do not contact us.”  Reputation Changer aka Brand.com believes the new name will pay for itself by leading to new business:  “With higher visibility, we’re on track to making online reputation management a central facet of brand management for all organizations.” Brand.com COO and president Mike Zammuto said in a statement. “We know individuals, companies and governments need help protecting their names against those who would use the internet as a forum for slander and debasement. As Brand.com, we’re here not just to protect reputation but the whole brand.”  Interestingly, original owner Pettis sold the name as part of a transition to working full-time for MakerBot, which was just sold to Stratasys for $403 million.  That company was founded by his son, Bre Pettis, in 2009.

"Loggly Raises $500K To Search Your Log Files

 Updated  Loggly , a startup that helps developers manage web applications by aggregating and searching server logs, has raised a $500,000 first round of funding from True Ventures .  The San Francisco company is still building a prototype, but it describes its service as a simple, intuitive web-based user interface that allows developers to search through large numbers of log files from multiple applications. The idea is to provide greater transparency into how your applications are performing, and to identify exactly what’s happening when things go wrong.  The Loggly team already has some experience providing these kinds of features, since two of its three co-founders come from Splunk, which offers an engine for IT managers to search for problems in the log files of their company networks.  Loggly actually announced the funding on its blog back in December, but the tech press didn’t seem to notice until the deal was revealed in a regulatory filing today.  Update: Here’s how chief executive Kord Campbell described the difference between Splunk and Loggly:  We are a hosted solution compared to Splunk’s enterprise software download.  Instead of installing your own server, downloading the code, and forwarding logs to that server, you just send them to our system.  We run all the servers, storage, code, etc. for you, making life easier in the process.  It’s a hell of a lot cheaper too.  We’re leveraging a bunch of Open Source technologies to leap ahead in the search portions of our offering, which makes us more nimble than Splunk.  We’re focused on web app developers (like us) initially, providing development and monitoring features for them to maintain their code and systems.  Later on we’ll branch out into security, compliance, and analytics.  When it comes to analytics, we’ll be able to use the search system we’ve built to pull data from a customer’s logs, then run a map reduce algorithm on them to crank out statistics on the data.  For lots of data.  Think of it as a flip side to Google Analytics.  They take the log entries from browsers hitting your site – we take the entries from the hits to your server directly, through its logs.  Campbell also noted that while he and co-founder Raffael Marty worked on Splunk, they didn’t work on any of the search code, so there’s no intellectual property conflict.

"Ipad Air 2 Design Changes Mean Good And Bad For Ease Of Repair

 Apple announced the new iPad Air 2 just last week, and already the good people at iFixit have torn it apart. What they’re looking for: component parts that are designed into the device differently than in previous iterations, and what that means to the “repairability” of the device.  The iFixit teardown experts found a mixed bag with the Air 2.  On the plus side, they noted that the wiring is better positioned than in the first iPad Air . “Upon successfully opening the iPad Air 2, we immediately notice that all the display cables now reside near the lower edge,” iFixit writes in its teardown blog. “This is a welcome change from the previous iPad Air, whose digitizer and LCD cables effectively booby-trapped two edges of the display.”  On the other hand, the team found a few important things locked down and hard to remove and repair. “Upon removal of the logic board, we are saddened to see that the Lightning cable remains soldered to the logic board,” iFixit says in the blog. “This makes logic board removal even more of a chore. This also means that replacing the Lightning Connector requires replacing the entire logic board.”  Below are some of the main components of the new Air, as seen from the inside of the device.  You can find iFixit’s full teardown here .  Above: At 6.1 mm thick, the new iPad Air 2 is thinner than previous iPads, and is even thinner than the iPhone 6.

"Sony'S New Vaios Arrive On Schedule

Remember those Vaios we mentioned were coming? Well, here they are! You’ve got the L series (touchscreen all-in-one), X series (thin and surprisingly affordable), and the CW series (Blu-ray notebooks and apparently the home of Gossip Girl ). Check out the specs below. The X-series ultra-thin laptops are something we’ve been hearing about for a while. At 1.6lb and half an inch in thickness, they’re some of the sveltest out there, although the new Adamo has them beat by a bit. Unfortunately, they are rocking Atom processors, though they’re at least the new ones. Plus SSD, GPS, and a 3G connection from Verizon come standard. We’d have to see how that Atom performs, but $1300 is really not a bad asking price for such a sexy and capable little machine. The L-series is meant as a media hub, and optionally will have a TV card, HDMI-in, and DVR capabilities. It’s got a 24-inch 1920×1080 screen and the design looks chunky and solid. The configurations start at $1300 , but the specs are a joke if you want to do HD media on it. A Core2 Duo E5400? Come on. You’ll have to upgrade to the $1800 model if you want HDMI and a quad-core processor. The less said about the CW series , the better. The specs are nothing to write home about, although the inclusion of Blu-ray (in the most expensive model only) is nice. The best thing about them is the price: $800 to start , $920 at maximum. Decent all-purpose machines, but they’re not particularly sleek or portable, nor will they excel at HD or gaming. Still, the price is right. Sony is showing a good deal of value in these offerings; Vaio has traditionally been a rather expensive brand, but bringing it down essentially to ultrathin territory with this Atom-based X-series is probably a good move. People buying Vaio aren’t buying for the bits, but for the whole package. We’ll see how this touchscreen PC works out; that picture doesn’t really make it look comfortable and I think people will find desktop PCs aren’t the best thing to mix with touchscreens. Tablets, I tells ya! You can be sure that Sony will have a Vaio tablet by this time next year. In the mean time, these aren’t bad buys. Read the full press releases here if you’re into that kind of thing.

"Oneriot Leaves Beta With A New Engine To Find Trending Topics Before They'Re Trending

It was almost exactly a year ago when OneRiot launched its realtime search engine. At the time, the playing field was much different. “Realtime” was just emerging as a hot buzz word, and Twitter had about half of the features that it has now. Facebook had just started going realtime, and I’d argue that FriendFeed was still the actual king of realtime (obviously, this was before Facebook bought them). A lot has changed in a year. Today, OneRiot is rolling out a major revamp of both its site and some of its underlying architecture. The site itself looks much nicer and is better organized (sort of like a realtime Techmeme , in a way), but OneRiot’s site is just a fraction of what they do. That’s why the underlying architecture elements are much more interesting. In particular, OneRiot is today launching a new Trending Topics Engine, which it says is the fastest and most complete way to find the best things being shared on the web. That’s a pretty bold statement given the competition. But OneRiot believes it has them all beat because of their new algorithms which hunt down items before they’re actually popular. Obviously, how this works is all technical, but basically they take a look at various streams of data from sources including Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and Digg (Twitter is just a fraction of their overall data, they say). They then look for certain key phrases including things like “interesting” and “emerging” and flag the links attached to those elements to be “Trending Topic Candidates.” From here they assign weights to each of these items, and filter out the porn and the spam. Everything is then clustered together to make the data more readable. A lot of this is done through semantic calculation. There are a few steps from here, but you get the picture. OneRiot’s blog has a full rundown if you want to know more. While the obvious use for this is to allow people to find hot items on the web quicker, there are actually a few other reasons this speed is important. One is helping content-producing websites be able to know what stories to write about before they’re actually popular (but well on their way). OneRiot will be licensing a feed of this hot data to certain sites for this purpose (they won’t say which sites). So those sites that comb hot Google search results and write about those in the hope of ranking highly in hot searches may have found a new best friend. Another use for this new OneRiot Trending Topic Engine is to better target trending ads. One of OneRiot’s main products is RiotWise, its realtime ad placement service . If OneRiot is better at knowing what will be popular before it gets popular, obviously, this can only help these ads. And it’s a way to continue differentiating its product from the ad product Twitter recently unveiled. While Twitter ads allow brands to serve up certain tweets as ads at their choosing, OneRiot’s method automatically serves up these ads from brands to make sure they catch on to hot topics as quickly as possible. Again, this new Trending Topic data can only help that. The final way this new engine can help is with search results. While there are no shortage of services offering realtime search now (including Google, Bing, etc), the real key is knowing when a specific topic is popular enough to warrant it showing up. With this new data, OneRiot says its partners will be able to beat their competition to showing relevant realtime results. OneRiot actually built a display at their headquarters which shows their trending topics versus how quickly these topics show up on Bing, Google, Yahoo, and Twitter. I have to believe they wouldn’t have told me about such a display if they didn’t constantly beat their competition on it.

"Qualcomm Launches An Internet Processor For Networks

 Qualcomm is announcing today a new Qualcomm Internet Processor (IPQ) that will bring much faster performance to networking devices like home gateways, routers, and media servers.  The new chip features a dual-core Krait application processor with a new packet processor engine. That means it will enable a line of faster “smart home” devices. Qualcomm is touting the chip at its annual meeting with analysts today.  The IPQ product comes from Qualcomm Atheros, the division created after it acquired Atheros Communications for $3.1 billion two years ago. While wireless networks are getting faster, the actual throughput, or real networking performance, is often a lot lower than the theoretical maximum because the computing processors associated with the router or gateway are underpowered, said Todd Antes, the vice president of product management at Qualcomm Atheros, in an interview with VentureBeat.  “We believe a gateway or router device in a home needs to keep up,” Antes said. “The last couple of years, that has been driven by video.”  Overall, the technology will support data transfer rates of 5 gigabits per second across a variety of networks. That’s as much as three times the typical data rate.  The IPQ product line is aimed at handling the networking traffic related to next-generation networks full of video, sensor, or game content. That traffic is only expected to grow in the future.  The new chips will also enable new revenue opportunities for service providers by delivering new services such as security and surveillance. It will fit with the trend toward the “Internet of things,” a vision of the future where sensors monitor everything. It will fit in a scheme where you use your networking equipment to control your home automation settings and personal cloud.  Antes said the combination of Atheros and Qualcomm technology has enabled a better overall solution.  “We’re bringing some of the techniques of the mobile world into the network world,” Antes said. “So this device can scale down to low frequency and power when it is in standby mode.”  The first IPQ processors, the IPQ8062 and IPQ8064, are built in a 28-nanometer manufacturing process and will get 70 percent greater performance-per-watt than the nearest rival. The chips will be in commercial products in the first half of 2014.

"Strings: A Recommendation Engine That’S Transparent About Its Data Mining

 It’s no secret that companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google study our behavior to recommend products or push advertising our way.  A Bellevue, Washington-based company called Strings is trying to do the exactly that, but with very explicit user permission. Users can track the books they buy on Amazon, songs they enjoy on iTunes or other types of behavior on hundreds of other web sites. Combined with aggregated, anonymized data from other users, Strings can suggest products a person might like using a combination of techniques including collaborative filtering .  The product is designed to passively follow online activity like products you browse on Neiman Marcus’s Web site, provided you’ve activated Strings to track you on that property. You can fine-tune Strings to follow different kinds of behavior, whether it’s passive browsing or active behavior “starring”, “liking” or buying items. Users pick the online sites they want to monitor themselves on, and Strings doesn’t reveal information to advertisers. The company earns revenue through affiliate fees when it successfully recommends products that consumers later buy. Strings also has FriendFeed-style sharing, so you can send a feed of items you like to friends on the site. There are also granular privacy controls to manage who sees what.  “We believe that we’re an advocate for consumers. That’s precisely the reason we’re being upfront about tracking and why we offer people control over their data,” said Edward Balassanian, Strings’ chief executive and founder. The company has been self-funded to date.  Strings is part of a wave of companies like Blippy and Foursquare that try to incentivize and make users feel comfortable sharing their behavior. Provided you feel safe with this type of sharing, Strings might offer useful recommendations for books, music and all sorts of other products. If you’re privacy paranoid, then most online services have some sort of risk, and Strings tries to accommodate those concerns by offering detailed sharing controls.

"Storytelling App Steller Becomes More Of A Social Network

A beautifully designed mobile storytelling app Steller was introduced earlier this year to deliver on a simple premise: that our smartphones can do more than serve as our cameras or a quick way to post images to social networks like Facebook or Instagram, they’re also capable of being creative devices. Today, the company is rolling out an upgraded version of its application, with Steller 2.0 , an update that pushes the app more into social networking territory, with features like comments, @mentions, hashtags, search and other changes. For background, Steller was founded by ex-Google, ex-VMware, and ex-Microsoft veterans, including brother and sister design team Brian McAniff and Karen Poole , plus Jay Wilder . Tech veterans at Steller also include Vadim Spivak , Richard McAniff , and Mark Lucovsky . The app allows you to turn your photos and videos into stories, using a set of simple tools, designed from the ground-up for mobile devices. Today, Steller’s users are creating story collections that include both everyday images and videos, like of family, friends, or beloved pets, as well as more professional fare, like the stories created by food and DIY bloggers, or those of well-produced trip journals. You can see some of the better examples of those sorts of stories here, from creatives, authors, athletes, chefs, and others: Beth Kirby / @Local_Milk ; Jennifer Chong ; Oh Joy ; Alex Deibold ; Emily Harrington ; Katie Rodgers / @paperfashion ; Meagan Cignoli ; Red 6 ; Nichole Robertson ; Sophie Gamund ; or Tiffany Mitchell . Brands are also getting involved, like Burton Snowboards , for instance. However, until today, the Steller experience was more of using a well-crafted utility, rather than a social app. The Steller 2.0 release changes that. Now, a new “Explore” section lets you find the most popular and most viewed stories, as well as a curated set of stories per day and other featured collections. You can also now interact with those stories, by leaving comments and using hashtags. In addition, both hashtags and @mentions work in the comments and within the stories themselves, allowing users to reference other topics or other creators, connecting the stories together in more of a social networking structure. And you can dig up more of the stories you like to see through a search function, which also supports hashtags in addition to keywords. “I think we’re both parts a discovery network, for finding interesting content on topics that interest you, and also a social network where you can share your stories, connect with friends and family, as well as now connect with experts and influencers you follow,” explains Wilder. “Our vision is to keep building the best storytelling community that’s out there,” he says. The stories in Steller are beautifully done, and fun to browse through and read. But not everyone will be as interested in the creation process as they are in consuming the content itself. It’s a basic rule of Internet culture . So it makes sense that Steller would take its app in a direction that better highlights and supports ways to more passively search and partake in the content, rather than forcing everyone to spend time building stories themselves. My only concern with Steller, and apps like this, is that users may be putting in time creating content that won’t be around forever. Steller’s stories today can be viewed in the app as well as on the web, but for how long? While no startup will ever admit that one day, they will be no more (or they’ll have to exit to Facebook, e.g.), I worry about building these amazing mini-tales on a mobile application’s servers, rather on your own, or at least on a web host where you’re in control of when content goes up or comes down. But that may not matter to the mobile-first generation, who is more comfortable with the disposability of content, and apps, having grown up deleting from Facebook walls, and sending self-destructing photos in Snapchat. Hopefully, though, Steller’s stories won’t also self-destruct over time. They’re worth saving. The updated app is available for download here .

"Calling All Fintech: The Huge Small Business Opportunity Waiting For You (Webinar)

 Join us for this live webinar — Fintech: Capitalizing on significant “app”ortunity in small business — on Wednesday, February 25th at 10 am Pacific, 1 pm Eastern. Register here for free.  Several years ago it would have taken a leap of faith for small business owners to be interested in a cloud-based small business application to manage their day-to-day financial needs. Fast-forward a few years, and the consumer-led app revolution paired with mass-adoption of cloud computing has changed that entirely.  As a result, small businesses are experiencing a massive shift driven by technology, forcing more and more to adopt new technologies in order to compete. Add to this the consumerization of business, and it’s no surprise that cloud-based financial applications are becoming in-demand solutions for cash-strapped small businesses who need intuitive and economical alternatives.  Traditional banks haven’t been able to keep up. The type of creative innovation possible in the scrappy, get-it-done culture of startups just isn’t possible inside a large FI framework, particularly when talking about small business. With three primary customer segments banks must focus on — retail customers (regular consumers), commercial (large business), and small business — FIs have to spend a lot of time and effort chasing and servicing the first two, leaving them slower to innovate in the small business space.  That’s understandable. And slowly changing. Today, fintech startups and traditional banks are beginning to work together in a marriage that allows both to meet the fast-accelerating technology demands of small business. The upside for banks is that they can speed innovation to market by integrating non-bank providers into their eco-system — and develop new revenue models by offering small business customers best-in-breed solutions. For fintech startups, the opportunity to work with providers such as Yodlee who, in turn, offer a secure authenticated connection to the banks, opens up a tremendous opportunity.  The range of fintech apps emerging to meet the needs of SMBs span just about every category: budgeting and number-crunching, expense management, lending, payroll, invoicing, on-site sales, inventory management, and more.  But when asked about what’s brewing on the horizon, Greg Weddell, Practice Manager, Small Business for Yodlee, points to a portal strategy. “At the end of the day, a lot of these small businesses want an all-in-one solution that allows you to add or adopt those services you want — instead of having to establish relationships with each individual service provider. “  “Right now, ” he continues, “Small businesses still have to struggle to find out who has the best expense management application, who has the best travel management, or budgeting solution, or inventory, or payroll.”  Join Greg and a panel of experts from both banking and fintech for an animated discussion on how the development and startup community can capitalize on the tech transformation unfolding in the small business space.  What you’ll learn:   What’s happening in the small business fintech sector and what’s fueling its transformation  The convergence of small business technology  The dramatic growth of small business finapps and the future of small business  The impact of Big Data and key insights gleaned from it   Speakers  Greg Weddell, Practice Manager, Small Business, Yodlee Greg is responsible for spearheading Yodlee’s growth and innovation in SMB banking.

"Google’S Reign Of Terror Over Valley Workforce Coming To End?

 For two years, Google has brutalized its competition and other start-ups by grabbing the best talent with two sexy pieces of bait: the stock option, and its fun brand.  However, the first piece of bait, the stock option, has become decidely less sexy — and we may soon see more employees start to leave for more lucrative job opportunities.  Google has recognized this, creating an unusual options trading scheme it hopes will retain employees.  While Google’s stock price defied gravity through January this year — there are strong signs it may stall going forward (see graph below). It means that an employee hired a couple of weeks ago got their options at a price of $500, but now see the stocks valued at $481. If there’s little hope the stock will rise much, what’s the point of staying (aside from the apparently fun work atmosphere, which may be enough for many people, granted)?  That conundrum may be why Google has just introduced the options market, an online trading site that lets Googlers sell their shares to institutional investors — who are often willing to pay more than the current market price for an option to buy those shares in the future. The Merc’s Elise Ackerman has a good summary of the program here . For example, a Googler with options at $500 may think their shares are essentially worthless right now. However, traders on the futures market are offering to buy those options in January 2008 for a price of $500 a share — but not only that, they’re willing to pay $70 right now for the privilege — basically netting the employee $70 per share. Not bad if you’ve got an award of 1,000 or so shares.  The idea is to give employees some confidence that their shares are worth something, and motivate them, according to Dave Sobota, Google’s counsel.  However, “it its just as likely that it will encourage them to sell,” counters Nell Minow, co-founder of the Corporate Library, a governance advisory firm. After all, the average employee has 700 shares, and the resulting $49,000 net does not a fortune make.  A trickle of employees have left Google so far, but mostly those early employees who made bucketloads. We’ve yet to see a wave of employees successfully poached by other companies. When Googlers leave, it’s usually to do their own thing. That may be changing soon. (Image above of lavalamps is from Google’s  job page ).

"Slicethepie, The Crowdfunding Platform For Artists, Partners With Umg'S Fontana

Slicethepie , the web-based artist financing engine that lets musicians and bands raise money to make a professional record, has partnered with Fontana Distribution, the “indie” arm of Universal Music Group Distribution. The arrangement will see Fontana act as a sort of A&R middle-person by recommending the best Slicethepie artists to their network of over 80 labels across the U.S. each month, thus offering the potential for an actual record deal or at least formal, albeit, independent label distribution. Though comparable to other crowdfunding platforms, such as Sellaband , Slicethepie mixes social features in which fans help discover new talent and offer funding through a stock exchange system where they can also trade their artist investments. Fans can get a return on their money based on a percentage of sales of the final record, with Slicethepie taking a commission on the re-sell of artist investments (called ‘contracts’) and a royalty of any record sales generated. However, as of today, the royalty is being dropped , so that financed artists now keep 100% of proceeds from their completed EP or album. Along with that change and the Fontana partnership, Slicethepie has also announced other changes to its service: full conversion to $US, and complimentary subscriptions for artists to the premium services offered by Tunecore, SoundOut, Nimbit, SoundCloud, Sonic Bids, and Jango. On that note, Grace Hammond, SVP Marketing at Slicethepie, comments “We’re delighted that so many of the leading players in the digital music ecosystem have pledged their support to artists securing finance on Slicethepie.  This, combined with the Fontana partnership, will give them the best chance of building a career both online and through the traditional label structure.”

CompUSA, everyone’s favorite place to hang out while waiting for the sig. other to come out of Kohl’s, is closing 126 stores, or 50% of its current crop, to create a cash infusion of $440 million. Most of these stores are “old” which presumably means they were laid out in the 1800s and are no longer competitive in the face of Best Buy and Circuit City. The closure is coming in the next two or three months and there is some talk that owner Carlos Slim, the third richest man in the world, might sell the business outright and retire to his aerie high above the Swiss Alps where he will watch the tribulations of man, chuckling softly.

"Fallout 3 Cosplay Looks Like The Business

With enterprising individuals making such elaborate costumes as Samus Aran and Master Chief , I suppose it’s no surprise that the Brotherhood guys from Fallout are now being cosplayed. It actually reminds me a lot of the special unit from Jin-Roh . Verrry similar. Man, now that was a good movie. The costume is obviously not full metal like the “real” one, and consequently I doubt it would protect very well against super mutants. Fortunately, there are none of those in Seattle, so I can suit up with confidence.

"Why Did Testflight Sell To Burstly? “We Couldn’T Change The App Ecosystem Alone”

TestFlight could have been a safe little business, but co-founder Ben Satterfield is a true entrepreneur, and his dreams are not so small. Before today, only the most successful mobile app developers could afford sophisticated real-time usage and revenue data tracking. Costs prevented indie developers from getting the data they needed to build great apps and games. By being acquired by in-app ad management platform Burstly  (scooped by MG Siegler for PandoDaily) , Satterfield’s team gained the resources necessary to launch TestFlight Live, democratize this data, and get better apps built for everyone. Satterfield tells me “This is us believing in the bigger vision. [The original TestFlight] is a great product on its own, and we could have charged and gone scrappy with it month to month, but we want to wake up every day and go after something big.” That’s why TestFlight didn’t slap a subscription fee on its free iOS app testing platform, or port the same features to Android. It saw a big gap in measurement tools for mobile devs, realized the platform owners Apple and Google couldn’t or wouldn’t solve the problem, and it seized the opportunity. Developers can now leave the pre-launch TestFlight code in their apps to gain access to TestFlight Live’s engagement and monetization data from real users. In social games on the web, Zynga used its funding and early success to build powerful data analysis and game optimization tools that helped it crush smaller competitors going on hunches. This arguably reduced innovation across the space. TestFlight could protect the burgeoning mobile app industry from the same fate. With TestFlight Live’s dashboard, even tiny studios can watch install rates, and what levels users are getting stuck on, but also revenue rates and which ads are driving clicks — all from a single screen. Ties to Burstly’s multi-network ad management platform will make it so developers aren’t at the mercy of a single ad network. Burstly’s CEO Evan Rifkin tells me, “Once they understand lifetime value and average revenue per user, they’ll know what they want to build, how much to spend on marketing, how many developers to hire, and it will allow the app economy to flourish.” When asked if the TestFlight team was worried that Apple could steamroll them with its own app testing and measurement platform, Satterfield explained, “We all love Apple obviously, but what they do is they champion the consumer.”  Rifkin chimed in, “It’s in our minds but not something we’re really worried about. Developers are important to them, but consumers are #1. We built this because we wanted it, and it’s our only focus.” Rifkin also noted that Apple would never build something that also supported Android. Now,TestFlight doesn’t support Android yet either, but Satterfield says “it’s something we’re consistently thinking about. There’s specific pain points in developing for that platform, and we’d want to make [an Android version] specific to those needs.” A higher priority, though, was getting TestFlight Live out the door and improving the original TestFlight’s UI. Developers can actually get a sneak preview of the next iteration of TestFlight right now by going into their account and enabling ‘v2’ in the “Area 51” section. Satterfield calls it a “beta beta”, and asks devs to turn v2 off once they’ve had a look, as all the kinks aren’t out yet. If you could hear how passionate Satterfield and Rifkin are about empowering developers, you’d stop asking “Why not go it alone?” Rifkin rallies, “It’s such a bold, difficult mission, even as a combined company. I don’t think there’s a chance in hell Burstly or TestFlight could have done it by themselves. The path we were on was cool, but that’s not why we’re working our asses off and getting very little sleep.” There’s something grander at stake than mobile ads or beta testing. It’s about helping creators create. “We can get the data to every developer, and raise up the entire app ecosystem. That’s the religion that brings two companies together when they’re doing well on their own.”

"Nyk Super Eco Ship 2030: How Ships Will Look Like In The Future

It looks like a vessel straight out of Star Trek, but it’s going to be a real ship soon(ish). Japan-based Nippon Yusen KK (NYK) is developing a “green” container ship that emits 69% less CO2 than existing models . The so-called NYK Super Eco Ship 2030, which is currently in design stage, will be 353-meters long and mainly powered by fuel cells. NYK says the ship’s fuel cells (40 megawatts) will use liquefied natural gas as a hydrogen source. In emergency cases, solar and wind power systems will supply additional energy. The ship will be built using newly developed friction-resistant material in order to boost its eco-friendliness. NYK plans to complete development of the futuristic vessel by 2030.

"Can We All Please Grow Up And Get A Real Ringtone?

We’ve all been sitting in a movie, waiting in a line, or sleeping in church, only to be annoyed by a dumb ringtone. For some reason, random people across all generations think that everyone else wants to hear a Boom Boom Pow or animal sound ringer. Well, we don’t. This is nothing new. There was a time before MP3 ringers when polyphonic ringtones were all the rage. In fact, I can remember back about seven years ago creating my own tone for my Sprint PCS Vision Samsung cell phone out of a N.E.R.D. song. I was the coolest back then, but thankfully for society, I have grown up and moved to a boring, stock BlackBerry ringtone. Watch the video above and then go switch your ringer to a normal tone. Listen, everyone occisionally forgets to switch to silent or vibrate, but for the love of BlackBerry, at least have a ringer that you wouldn’t be mortified if it went off at a Presidential news conference .

"Aggregate Knowledge Grabs Interest, Will Raise $20M

 Aggregate Knowledge , the company that tracks Internet user surfing patterns within a site, has become one of the hotter start-ups in Silicon Valley.  It is about to raise $20 million, and rumors are circulating that interest by venture capitalists is pushing the company valuation north of $50 million (before the investment). This is significant because the company launched less than a year ago, and is already raking in millions of dollars.  We wrote the announcement by Overstock , which said using Aggregate Knowledge boosted its sales significantly over the holiday period. In Overstock’s case, Aggregate Knowledge works by watching the patterns of users on Overstock.com, i.e., what sort of things they end up buying after visiting certain pages and clicking particular links. Aggregate Knowledge can then make quicker purchase recommendations or promotions to users who follow and who show similar patterns â€” or at least that is what claims, and what Overstock is confirming.  Notably, the accuracy of Aggregate Knowledge’s discovery and recommendation engine could enable it to monetize internet users at above-market rates. The big bet here could be that if the company can monetize others sites’ traffic better than sites themselves, there is a large opportunity here, with potentially significant network effects.

"The Biggest Problem With Same-Day Shipping: It’S Not Fast Enough

  Earlier today, I bought a new wireless router on Amazon, which the company says I’ll get by Thursday. The problem: I want it right now .  For Amazon, eBay, and, most recently, Google , the solution for impatient, lazy people like me is simple — same-day shipping. But while same-day shipping is pretty fast by current standards, it’s still not fast enough for Tom Allason, the CEO of same- hour shipping service Shutl . Allason says consumers are already looking for something better than same-day, and the sad part is that he’s completely right.  “Expectations about shipping speed are moving fast. It’s quite simply inevitable that consumers are going to want something better than same-day. They just don’t know it yet,” Allason said.  To illustrate how this dynamic works, Allason took a page from comedian Louis CK’s now-infamous “ Everything’s Amazing and No One’s Happy ” routine. In that story, online shoppers take on the role of Louis CK’s unhappy planemate, who complains about the malfunctioning in-flight Wi-Fi he only just learned existed. For consumers, same-day shipping is that in-flight Wi-Fi.  The problem, Allason says, is that the definition of what’s “amazing” over time shifts closer and closer to “commonplace.” It won’t be long until same-day shipping just isn’t a major feat anymore, and consumers are going to want more .  Above: Not. Fast. Enough.  Shutl’s solution to this should be pretty obvious: Rather than focus on same-day shipping, it’s pushing things a bit further with same-hour shipping, which Shutl pulls off by working alongside local shops and carriers, not big, distant warehouses.  And the system seems to work pretty well: Shutl’s current shipping record is roughly 15 minutes, which makes “same-day delivery” sound archaic in comparison. (The service right now is only available in the U.K., though Allason says a multicity U.S. launch is planned for this year.)  What’s strange, though, is that the more I listened to Allason’s take on the state of shipping, the more I realized that he wasn’t talking about shipping at all. Shutl is really a delivery service, something closer to your pizza guy than your Fed-Ex truck driver. And maybe that’s exactly the point.  “E-commerce is almost unrecognizable now from how it looked when it started, but we’re still waiting a day or many days for a delivery. The shipping experience just hasn’t changed very much,” Alason said.  You can probably see where this is going. “But what about instant shipping?” I asked, hoping to take the conversation to its most absurd extreme.  Allason, however, had a response ready: “Star Trek-like teleporters and networks of 3D printers. People are already making these things happen,” he said.  I don’t even want to know what happens when consumers aren’t happy with teleporters .   FedEX Bro: Flickr/DaveFayram

"Gamestick Gets More Colors And Microsd Support If Backers Meet New Goals

  GameStick’s Kickstarter surged past its $100,000 goal a mere 30 hours into the campaign. Now, PlayJam — the developer behind the Android-based gaming console — has some new plans up to $560,000 in its sights.  GameStick is a teeny tiny thumb-drive-sized HDMI device that fits into a television input. It then operates as a full gaming console for Android games. It’s similar to the Ouya console, which raised north of $8 million on the crowdfunding site.  With 22 days left to raise money, the Kickstarter campaign sits at over $270,000. That prompted PlayJam to introduce stretch goals at $320,000; $450,000; and $560,000.   $320K goal — Users will get a choice of color between black and white.  $450K goal — PlayJam will add red to the previous two choices and a fourth color based on a popular vote.  $560K goal — Every GameStick console gets a MicroSD card slot to expand the device’s storage capacity by up to 32GB.    To vote on the fourth color that unlocks at the $450,000 level, head to GameStick’s Facebook page . I’m gonna vote for puce.  Obviously, the big thing here is the MicroSD slot. GameStick already provides owners with unlimited cloud storage in addition to the unit’s built-in 8GB capacity, but gamers were hoping for more. They might not always have full access to the Internet — especially if they’re traveling.  A 32GB card will expand the system’s storage space to 40GB, which is a lot for Android games.

"Kindle Fire Hd 8.9 Is $50 Cheaper For Students This Month

  Every dollar counts if you’re the typical college kid nowadays. Amazon knows this, which is why the e-commerce giant is making its new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 a bit cheaper for students this month.  During January, Amazon will cut the price of the tablet by $50, making it as cheap as $249 for the ad-supported 16GB model. The 4G LTE model will run as low as $449 with the discount.  The deal is not particularly surprising; it shows just how much Amazon has integrated its various devices, services, and media content. Students who purchase the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 aren’t just buying a tablet — they’re buying into the Amazon media content and Prime ecosystem as well. Make no mistake: Amazon’s main mission is to lock its customers in and never let them go.  The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 deal does come with two limitations. For one, it requires that buyers enroll  in Amazon’s Student program, which requires a .edu email address. A bigger hindrance, perhaps, is that buyers will also need a subscription to Amazon Prime, which costs $49 a year for students. Fortunately, Amazon also offers free six-month subscriptions to Prime, which should make the discount that much more enticing.

"Ezra’S Craft Liquor Marketplace Helps You Understand All The Subtle Notes Of Your Drink

At some point in most everyone’s life, alcohol consumption goes from a sport wherein players try to get pounded in the most efficient way possible to an activity all in itself, where people actually enjoy the taste, the flavors, and the experience of drinking a fine liqueur. But going from ordering a “Jack and Coke” or tequila shots to buying top-shelf spirits can be a difficult leap to make. That’s where Ezra’s comes in. It’s a curated marketplace for craft distilleries to sell their vodka, gin, tequila, rum, or whiskey, with complete and educational information about what to expect out of every bottle. Users can browse based on what’s popular, search for particular liquors or brands, shop by what’s new, or look at Ezra’s curated picks. But Ezra’s goes beyond a simple marketplace, offering distillers the chance to post videos, recipes, and tips to connect directly with their customers. Usually, craft distillers work directly with wholesale buyers and liquor stores, never really connecting with the folks who are buying their product. Plus, Ezra’s truly opens up distribution for most craft distillers who, based on regulations in most states, are only allowed to sell online in states where they are sold by retailers. With Ezra’s every distiller can sell to up to 40 different states. With today’s launch, Ezra’s is opening up shop with a portfolio of over 125 different liquors, along with ingredients needed to make the original recipes found on the site. The best part of Ezra’s is that it takes education around the products seriously. You could visit Ezra’s without a cent to your name and walk away more confident for your next trip to the bar. Additionally, Ezra’s is launching a brick-and-mortar flagship store today in Chicago. The whole thing is funded and conceived by twins Adam and Parker Newman and their childhood friend Scott Reich. The Newmans come from a private equity background, and have put up their own money to get Ezra’s up and running. If you want to check out Ezra’s for yourself, click here .

"Tech M&A, Ipos Were Up Considerably In The Second Quarter

 Mergers and acquisitions in the tech space flourished in the second quarter of 2014, further extending the momentum that had built up in the first quarter.  The thriving M&A picture was helped forward by improving macroeconomic conditions, high equity markets, VC investment levels, and IPO activity.  So says PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which released its findings in its U.S. Technology Deals Insights Q2 2014 , an analysis of second-quarter tech deals in 2014.  Similar to the previous quarter, software and Internet M&A deals were most numerous. Deal values increased materially within the hardware and semiconductor sectors, PwC says.  The report says the overall number of technology transactions — 62 of them — increased by 87 percent over the second quarter of 2013. The transactions totalled $26.7 billion, while the average deal value was $430 million, a slight increase from $406 million deal average in the first quarter, PwC says.  However, the average deal value was down somewhat from the $510 million average of deals in the past 12 months. Four deals were valued at more than $1 billion during the fourth quarter.  “After a strong start during the first quarter of 2014, the second quarter followed suit with an increase in the number of technology deal announcements,” said Rob Fisher, PwC’s U.S. technology industry deals leader, in a statement.  Fisher says that while the number of new billion-dollar deals announced in the second quarter was in line with first quarter, the number of smaller and medium-sized transactions grew.  Technology IPOs picked up in the second quarter. PwC counted 22 new pricings with proceeds exceeding $5.1 billion. Twenty new IPO registrations were announced during the quarter, and, PwC notes, a number of unannounced IPO filings were filed confidentially under a dome of silence created by the JOBS Act.  “This upward trend in IPO markets combined with the tremendous pent-up cash balances of the leading technology players bodes well in driving the momentum of technology M&A through the remainder of the year,” Fisher says.  The software sector, which has traditionally been characterized by smaller deals, had the greatest aggregate deal value in the quarter. The 20 transactions coming from the sector totaled $4.1 billion. The number of deals grew 18 percent from the first quarter, while the overall value of the deals declined 44 percent from the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter last year, deal volume increased 150 percent and value increased 163 percent.  With the proliferation of Internet-connected and wearable devices, PwC sees the Internet of things continuing to evolve, with these trends driving the demand for specialized semiconductor components and software to enhance them. It also believes cloud, mobile, and social technology as drivers of new value in the sector.

"Sunrun’S Journey Shows That There Is Rarely A Straight Line To Success

 With $2 billion worth of solar panels installed on 70,000 customers’ homes across 12 states, Sunrun is well on the way to proving that its model for solar power generation can work.  But it wasn’t always so clear. When the company started, in February 2007, cofounder and chief executive Lynn Jurich says she faced an enormous amount of skepticism.  “It was a hard model,” she said. She had trouble convincing investors to back Sunrun because they were concerned about how capital-intensive the business would be. And a look at the string of solar company failures over the past few years suggests that investors may have been right: Solar is a risky, capital-intensive business.  Before you can start generating electricity from the sun, you need to install a lot of solar panels. A typical household rooftop solar system costs at least $12,000, and often as much as $30,000. Jurich’s idea was that Sunrun would install these systems on houses, but retain ownership of them — and then make money by selling electricity, at below-market rates, to the owners of the houses.  In effect, Sunrun is building a vast, distributed solar power generation plant by renting space on people’s rooftops. The “rent” it pays comes in the form of a discount on the electricity it sells. Win-win: Homeowners get to go green, they benefit from cheaper electricity, and they don’t have to give up anything other than roof space they weren’t using anyway; Sunrun gets cheap “land” and can profit from the difference between its costs and what it receives for selling that power.  “The model on its face makes a ton of sense,” Jurich told me in a recent interview. “Homeowners already buy a ton of electricity as a service, and who wants to spend a ton of money to buy a solar system and maintain it themselves?”  There’s an additional advantage: The federal government offers a tax credit for homeowners to install solar systems. By installing it for them, Sunrun gets to claim those tax credits, which it can then sell to banks or other companies.  Long story short: This is a tricky financing play. By getting banks to front the money for solar panel installations, Sunrun can build those panels — then pay the banks back in tax credits and in the cash made by selling electricity.  Above: Sunrun cofounder and CEO Lynn Jurich eventually found her happy place, it seems. Image Credit: Sunrun  But before the economic engine could get humming, Sunrun had to prime it with a few customers. And it couldn’t get customers without having some money to build solar systems for them. So after closing its initial funding round of $12 million, Jurich and her partners funded the first crop of solar panels out of the company’s cash equity. It used that momentum to try and raise the debt financing it needed to continue growing.  But it was a tough sell, because they were trying to raise that money in the teeth of the 2008 recession, from loan originators that were used to lending money for multibillion dollar power plants, not distributed networks of home solar panels. If you’re loaning somebody $2 billion to build a power plant, you know where the money is going, and it’s easy to evaluate if the business is doing well. $2 billion to build a bunch of solar panels is a whole different thing.  Eventually, Jurich says Sunrun was able to close a first $40 million round of debt from U.S. Bank. And then, in late 2011, the federal government changed the solar panel subsidy, ending one of the company’s major selling points.  “It changed the value proposition we were offering consumers, and our sales totally fell off the cliff,” Jurich says. It was, she says, really hard to get capital and customers in balance for the first few years of the company’s existence.  “It was like, ok, we got the capital — but now, whoops, the value proposition changed and we don’t have the customers,” Jurich says.  The situation was bad enough that Jurich and her cofounders contemplated winding the business down. Without the subsidy, it looked like the market opportunity might not exist any more.  But Jurich says she stuck with it, partly because she was on the front lines of the business. She knew what customers wanted, and she had a sense that Sunrun could still make a compelling pitch to them. That gave her the confidence to continue pushing through, she says.  Not every entrepreneur does that — many hire a sales executive, and then stop going on sales calls, so they lose touch with what customers really want.  “Let’s say you’re a product girl, or you’re a technology girl, so that’s your comfort zone,” Jurich says. “Don’t overly rely on bringing in the sales person — you need to be in every one of those phone calls so that you’re able to tweak your business model and your product and make tough calls about the longevity of the market.”  Ultimately, Sunrun tweaked its pricing, stayed in the market, and went on to raise $2.8 billion in debt financing, of which $2 billion has been deployed building homeowner solar systems.  “And then Solarcity came along and copied us,” Jurich laughs.  (She hastens to add: Solarcity is more of a frenemy than a direct competitor. While larger than Sunrun, it’s more focused on commercial installations — and the retail electricity market opportunity , for now, is far bigger than both of them.)  Much of this story is captured in a cute, animated video narrated by Jurich and produced by one of Sunrun’s backers, Foundation Capital . I’m embedding it here because it’s a rare look at the ups and downs of an entrepreneur’s journey. Too often we hear the sanitized, mythologized version of a founding story. And no doubt this story has been edited to remove the really gnarly parts too. But in general, it’s a refreshing look at how much of a nail-biter Sunrun’s early phase was.  Many other companies can no doubt tell similar stories.

"When In Doubt, Launch An Adult Social Networking Site Creator. Yes, That'Ll Work.

Last year yet another ‘build your own social network’ appeared. SocialGO was a white-label social networking site creator spun out of UK company Bright Things . SocialGO lets you create an online community website which is either stand-alone or inside an existing website. All the usual features like IM, content-sharing for photos and videos, blogging tools etc are there. Clearly things may not have gone to plan though. There are any number of these companies. Let me see now (deep breath) Ning, PeopleAggregator, SocialSpring, OneSite, GoingOn, CrowdVine, Mzinga, Haystack, CollectiveX, Moli, KickApps, DZOIC, Pringo, SmallWorldLabs and in the UK, WebJam and Kwiqq.  And all of them arrived well before SocialGO. Ning of course has Marc Andreessen as Chairman and well over 100 million dollars in funding. So what’s the answer? What can be user-generated virtually for free, is in high demand and creates a lot of traffic? Yes! Porn! Thus, Zocku.com , a white label social networking platform dedicated to adult networks which has SocialGO as its underlying platform, has been money-shot into existence. Apparently there are already plenty of customers with one “generating in excess of $5,000 a month in ad revenue and membership fees.” One client says Zocku.com “has created a more complete and satisfying experience for Ruffkin’s members.” I’m sure it has. In other words, it may well be the case that SocialGO launched and then found itself inundated with porn merchants, as happened to Ning – something which nearly destroyed the company until it banned them. The question only remains. How Bright did Bright Things have to be to dream this move up? The words “not” and “very” spring to mind.

"The Incubator Bubblet: Yeurope, Techstars, Hitforge…

 We were just talking about the buzz YCombinator has generated with its incubator model.  Now others are copying it. Paul Böhm has launched a European clone, called YEurope , and his site is awfully similar to YCombinator’s. ( Techcrunch has more about YEurope’s copying of the investment model too, which is based on the number of founders, i.e., 5000€/each, and taking a 2-10% stake in the company.) Eight start-ups travel to Vienna to work on their companies.  Others are popping up, another strange reminder of the good ol’ days of 1999, when incubators were all the rage. We’ve mentioned Techstars in Colorado. And most recently, serial entrepreneur Naval Ravikant of San Francisco has launched HitForge . He calls it a “cooperative,” where entrepreneurs apply to join HitForge and then they band together in teams to launch companies. If projects fail, fine, the team moves on to something new. We pressed Ravikant for more details, such amount given to sustain entrepreneurs and the project’s stock structure, but he said it’s a work in progress.

"Expresso Gets $2 Million To Grow An Online Office Suite

eXpresso is an online collaboration tool around Excel spreadsheets. While a bit late to the game, they have plans to expand to other productivity tools as well. They will be announcing a new $2 million round of financing from Novus and Rocket Ventures on Monday, with the target of raising another $2 million soon. This is on top another couple million they’ve made off the sale of their original product, Smart DB, to Rocket Software (no relation to the venture group). The money will be put towards expanding their current Excel product and building a online Powerpoint application due out next Summer as well. However, eXpresso isn’t the usual AJAX online spreadsheet competitor. Rather, it’s a series of collaboration tools and back-end database secret sauce wrapped around Microsoft’s own online spreadsheet editor, Microsoft Excel Web Component. This avoids a lot of the compatibility issues faced by other editors when they try to import Excel documents on to their platforms. The company seems oddly positioned by leaning heavily on Microsoft’s technology, but CEO George Langan assures me that they can continue to develop the component without Microsoft’s support and have a great deal of patented IP in the database system they run on. Microsoft has abandoned the technology themselves, announcing an end to development of the Office Web Components. Instead, they are focusing on developing new technologies around Microsoft Sharepoint. The spreadsheet editor works smoothly, provides a familiar interface, and exposes a great deal of Excel’s desktop functionality online. You can edit cells, add formulas, sort, filter, and format. Google and Zoho have been aggressively adding a lot of these features themselves, but support auto-fill and charts as well. They also offer more applications. You can create a new file from within the program or sync one directly from Excel using their plug-in. eXpresso also offers file permissions (down to cell ranges), enables real time chat, and file management (version control, spreadsheet comparison). It’s currently free in beta, but will cost $10 or less per seat when it’s finally released into production.

"4 Juvenile Behaviors We Should Expect From Bots

 If the recent Microsoft Tay debacle tell us anything, it’s that we’re very far away from a robot takeover, no matter what the movies say. Standalone artificial intelligence (AI) is merely a teenager in the technological landscape, and no story proves this more than the 16-hour transformation of Microsoft’s teenybopper persona into a feminist-hating Nazi. AI may be taking over the popular consciousness, but in reality it’s a technology that just wants to fit in.  Here are four typical teenage traits we can expect from bots over the next year or so:  1. Growth spurts. The onslaught of bots appearing in the market has contributed to a series of growth spurts in artificial intelligence that have brought us intelligent personal assistants like Siri and, soon, self-driving cars. With each spurt, the technology advances a bit further and human acceptance increases. But just like with human growth spurts, this process can be painful and will inevitably result in mishaps and spasms along the way, as we saw with Tay and Google Photos before that.  2. Awkwardness. No matter how many maps of the English language AI may review, a computer will never be quite as much of a smooth talker as its older, human counterparts. Putting together a slick sentence with nuance takes a lot more than a mere grasp on language and an arsenal of fancy words. Today’s bots will confuse and confound most humans if left to construct sentences on their own. We’ll need to keep smoothing the rough edges and hand-holding our bots until they mature.  3. Lack of empathy. AI has yet to master a key life skill: understanding others’ emotions. As it stands, machine learning is more like a child: It’s capable of processing basic commands like “yes” and “no.” Until a program can comprehend intangible concepts like “love” or “sorrow,” humans still need to play a role in bot training. Otherwise bots may become gaffe-prone.  “People tend to forget that empathy is a learned skill for humans, and the same is true for AI,” notes John C. Havens, author of Heartificial Intelligence: Embracing Our Humanity to Maximize Machines . “Thankfully, along with great strides in the field of affective computing (focused on emotion), there is a growing desire to implement ethical design methodologies that provably align AI outputs with end-users’ values.”  4. The need to fit in. AI is going through a stage of wanting to please its peers. Most robots at this point will do whatever humans tell them to do. There are roughly 30 technologies that fall under the umbrella term “artificial intelligence.” These include machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. Sabri Sansoy, the founder of WhizRobotics and a former MIT rocket scientist for USAF, believes Microsoft’s Tay bot was most likely an experiment in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and/or a variation of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a type of machine learning where an AI system learns both good and bad behavior through observations.  “The danger with RNNs and IRLs is that habits are being formed based on external pressures,” he said. “You wouldn’t want your behavior dictated by a group of Internet trolls. At this point, technologists need to be mindful of whom they want to be influencing their personas.”  When bots begin to actually counter people and offer differing opinions, that’s when we’ll begin to see AI’s full potential. Technologists will need to develop this area further, as well as give bots the ability to communicate in different languages and within different cultural contexts, in order to push artificial intelligence toward adulthood.  In spite of recent bad behavior, AI, like any teenager, holds the promise of something more. We’re seeing rapid progress in shifting the ratio of human versus machine messaging, but the last few areas — those related to human preference and empathy — will be disproportionately difficult to automate. Many experts in the field believe the next AI bot game-changer will be the development of software that mimics mirror neurons, which causes humans to reflect certain actions they see, like a yawn.  Many startups are entering the AI space, but the success of each startup and even AI as a whole will largely depend on careful execution that earns user trust — and that possibly even coaxes us into being better humans.

"Ex-Spot Runner Creative Chief Takes Former Employer Head On With Agencydivision

We’ve written many times about Spot Runner, the Los Angeles startup that is trying to apply web advertising techniques to TV, after the company was embroiled in controversy over the past year amidst massive layoffs and an alleged “pump and dump” scheme. WPP sued the Spot Runner for securities fraud and the lawsuit was later dismissed. It looks like some good may have come out of the mess. Simon Foster, Spot Runner’s head of creative operations, has started AgencyDivision, an ad agency that wants to help tech companies start TV ad campaigns. Foster claims that his team was responsible for nearly 90 percent of Spot Runner’s revenue over the past three years and saw an opportunity to flee the sinking ship. He took several of his team members and set of AgencyDivision, which takes a spin on the ‘open source’ advertising model. The startup aims to help launch Internet businesses into TV advertising through highly analytical and ROI positive TV campaigns. Foster says the agency just completed a TV commercial for one of Spot Runner’s largest clients (which is unnamed) and expects to see more clients cross over. Fosters’ AgencyDivision team basically had a similar role at Spot Runner, where they helped launch TV advertising campaigns ranging from local mom-and-pops to many nationally recognizable brands. The startup just launched recently, so it should be interesting to see if AgencyDivision can actually steal some of Spot Runner’s

"Could Health Apps Save Your Life? That Depends On The Fda

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates everything from heart monitors to horse vaccines, will soon have its hands full with consumer health apps and devices.  The vast majority of the health apps you’ll find in Apple’s or Google’s app stores are harmless, like step counters and heart beat monitors. They’re non-clinical, non-actionable, and informational or motivational in nature.  But the next wave of biometric devices and apps might go further, measuring things like real-time blood pressure, blood glucose, and oxygen levels.  You’ll begin to see these more advanced biometrics as we move from single-purpose fitness trackers like FitBit to more all-purpose devices like Apple’s upcoming “iWatch.”  Some have wondered if the FDA, in its current form, is up to the task of regulating these increasingly sophisticated devices and apps. Some in Congress have introduced bills calling for a new FDA office specifically tasked with approving and monitoring health apps.  More clinical apps  The FDA is charged with keeping watch on the safety and efficacy of consumer health products. Lately, that includes more clinical apps as well as devices you might buy at the drugstore, like a home glucose testing kit.  “It’s these apps that the FDA says it will regulate,” David Bates of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Physicians Organization told VentureBeat in June. These apps will have to go through the full 510(k) process ,” he said.  Dr. Bates chaired a group to advise the FDA on how to review health apps for approval, and on how the FDA should advise developers.  “It was intended to help them think through the risk factors involved with these products and then give guidance on how to stay within the guidelines,” he said.  “The device makers were asking from some guidance from The FDA on what types of things would be accepted and what wouldn’t,” Bates said.  Bates believes the FDA wants to use a light regulatory touch when looking at new medical devices. “The FDA definitely wants innovation to continue in clinical devices,” he said. “In general the FDA knows that the vast majority of apps are just informational.”  The FDA’s final guidance focuses on a small subset of mobile apps that present a greater risk to patients if they do not work as intended.  The FDA’s position  FDA spokeswoman Jennifer Rodriguez writes in an email to VentureBeat that her agency has become more focused in its regulation of heath apps.  “The mobile medical apps that the FDA is focusing on may impact the performance or functionality of currently regulated medical devices or may independently pose a greater risk to consumers,” she writes.  The FDA, she writes, is mainly concerned with two types of app/device combinations:   Apps that are used as an accessory to medical device already regulated by the FDA (for example, an application that allows a clinician to access an image from a hospital image database, then make a specific diagnosis based on it.)    Apps that are turn a regular smartphone or tablet into a medical device by using the device’s sensors, software or accessories for some diagnostic purpose (for example, an app that turns a smartphone into an ECG machine to detect abnormal heart rhythms).   “We encourage app developers to contact the FDA as early as possible if they have any questions about their mobile app, its level of risk, and whether a premarket application is required,” Rodriguez adds.  The problem is that the line between “consumer-focused” and “clinical-focused” may be getting blurrier — and may continue to move.  Some of the consumer health apps and devices that will soon be connecting with the new health platforms offered by large tech companies like Apple (Health Kit) and Google (Google Fit) may present new mixtures of clinical and non-clinical features and functions. The agency is now, and will need to continue, refining its review and approval process for such products.  A costly process  And many app and device developers may look for reasons to assume their product falls outside the scope of the agency. They won’t have to look very hard.  “The FDA approval process is a lengthy one and there is a significant capital outlay involved,” Brigham and Womens’ Bates told VentureBeat. “They must pay for attorneys to help with the long application preparation process.”  Many developers have, and will likely continue to “go it alone,” developing independent of FDA guidelines, under the assumption that their product is non-clinical.  And what about the apps and devices that receive FDA approval, then pivot or evolve into a more clinically oriented purpose later on?  Those two groups create a large class of products that exist outside the regulatory gaze, and could potentially harm consumers if they give inaccurate or otherwise misleading information.  An inaccurate blood pressure or blood glucose level reading could lead to an unnecessary trip to the emergency room. Or worse, and app might fail to detect a serious problem, causing the user to neglect to seek necessary medical help.  A new FDA group  Epstein Becker & Green attorney Brad Thompson believes the FDA needs a special group to monitor consumer health apps and devices that are already being used in the wild.  “Within the compliance division at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, (that’s the unit within FDA that has responsibility for medical devices), they should develop a small unit, perhaps even just one person, to spend their time looking at the various mobile app marketplaces, searching for certain keywords that are indicative of FDA regulated functionality,” Thompson says.  Thompson advises medical device, drug, and combination product companies on FDA regulatory, reimbursement, and clinical trial issues.  “When they find an app where the promotion seems to cross the line into regulated territory, they should send a gentle letter to the company pointing that out and asking what they’ve done to come into compliance,” Thompson says.  “It would really not take much in the way of resources to do exactly that. I think they’re doing a little bit of that now, but not very much,” he adds.  Health apps go mainstream  The big software companies (Apple, Google, and Samsung) have brought attention to, and lent credibility to, apps and devices that do more than count steps. These companies are building large cloud platforms designed to collect health data from all sorts of health apps and devices.  But most agree that none of these software giants want to get caught up in any large scale entanglements with government agencies over product safety regulations.  “At the end of the day, whatever they [the large tech companies] create should be designed to be interoperable with both the consumer world and clinical world,” says Dr. Molly Malouf, MD, an expert in digital health technology, in an email to VentureBeat.  “The big tech companies have to be smart enough to recognize the regulatory barriers and to hire FDA approval experts,” Malouf says.  And what if the devices and apps connecting with these large clouds do start trending toward serious clinical and diagnostic applications? Would the big platform plays like Health Kit, Google Fit , and SAMI suddenly be reconsidered and shut down after causing the companies too much legal exposure?  Well, it wouldn’t be the first time. Look no further than Google’s doomed attempt at putting health records online back in 2011.

"Splacer, With $1.4M In New Funding, Is Airbnb For Event Spaces

Splacer , the Tel Aviv-based marketplace for listing and renting out creative event space, today announced that it has raised $1.4 million in seed funding led by Carmel Ventures. A number of angel investors, including Shlomo Kramer, Sam Ben Avraham, and Eyal Shaked, also participated in the round, Alongside the funding announcement, Splacer is also going live with a beta product in New York City. What Airbnb does for longer-term stays in a home, Splacer does for short-term event spaces. Users can list personal or commercial space, set prices, and users can rent them out for different types of events. The company was founded in Tel Aviv by architects Lihi Gerstner and Adi Biran, and launched in the fall of 2014. Splacer has since grown to have over 100 event spaces listed in Israel, and is launching with 70 spaces listed in New York City. The Splacer founders told TechCrunch that the platform isn’t meant for big parties, though of course that will likely end up being a minor use case. Rather, Splacer’s predominant use cases thus far have been company off-sites, photo shoots, and art exhibitions. Not all spaces are approved to be on the network, as the company wants to curate the assortment of spaces listed in the marketplace. Users can rent spaces both by the hour or by the day. Plus, users are offered a network of service providers, ranging from caterers to musicians to photographers (and even aerial dancers), so that they can plan the entirety of an event through a single portal. So far, Splacer has worked with companies like Facebook, Fiverr, Outbrain, and Playbuzz (among others) in Tel Aviv to offer creative spaces for corporate events

"Kleiner Trial Is A Front Row Seat To A Vc Firm In Flux

“Didn’t you tell Ms. Pao at the time that one of the reasons you chose Randy Komisar to be a board partner was that Randy ‘needed a win’?” asked Alan Exelrod, the lead counsel for the plaintiff in the case of Ellen Pao V. Kleiner Perkins . This came during a particularly tense point in the questioning of John Doerr in San Francisco’s Superior Court today. Exelrod was pressing Doerr for answers as to why Komisar, rather than Pao, was appointed to the board of a startup called RPX in 2008. To that question, Doerr, who has been portrayed thus far by all of the trial’s witnesses as a strong supporter of women in technology and venture capital, provided one of the most animated responses he’d given up until that point in his testimony. He asserted that his actions had nothing to do with gender. “Randy needed a win. Kleiner needed a win. Everybody needs wins,” he said. “I could use some wins,” Doerr concluded with a wry laugh. It was funny, but it also rang painfully true. Few things are crystal clear at this point in the often plodding Pao V. Kleiner Perkins trial, which has entered its second week in court and currently has no end in sight. But one notable thing that has emerged in the ongoing testimony is that Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , a Sand Hill Road stalwart since it was founded in 1972, experienced quite a fall in recent years. To be clear, today Kleiner is arguably in a much better position than it was from 2007 to 2012, the time period around which much of the Pao trial is focused. Presently, the firm’s Digital Growth Fund, which Doerr leads along with Mary Meeker, has a number of investments in hot, high growth, high profile startups such as Slack, Instacart, Snapchat, and Uber. But there were some rough years in between. Over the past decade, KPCB faced a number of things that chipped away at its dominance — lackluster investments in green tech, competition from upstart firms and increasingly powerful angel investors, and the damage to its reputation from the ongoing salacious legal case, to name a few. At the time, Kleiner had been able to gloss over its turbulence quietly, with very little public documentation (though there was a good deal of mostly private chatter in Silicon Valley circles .) But now that the firm’s dealings from the past nine years are under subpoena, what really happened is being laid out for all to see. The ongoing court proceedings are providing a front-row view into what happens to a proud institution while it is at risk of losing its mojo. On the stand this past week, Kleiner’s top partners have been forced to confirm publicly for the first time that the firm did in fact conduct layoffs in 2012 as part of a necessary downsizing. At the time, the changes were first reported in a series of exclusives in Term Sheet , the excellent and scoop-driven newsletter that’s become a must-read for the finance industry. The situation was then portrayed as a natural progression for the firm, positioning partners who had previously been labeled as rising stars leaving of their own volition. Those headlines at the time read, “ Exclusive: Big changes coming to Kleiner Perkins ,” “ Exclusive: Kleiner Perkins makes major changes ,” and “ Kleiner’s Chi-Hua Chien may raise his own VC fund .” (I later reported for TechCrunch that sources said Chien’s new fund was a result of him being transitioned out of Kleiner, but hadn’t been able to get word from Chien or KPCB on the matter.) In reality, it’s come out this past week, partners including Chien were directly asked to leave the firm, as KPCB was forced to tighten up its ranks after a number of damaging losses. “In 2012, the partnership was not performing at the level it should have been. It had gotten too big, and our decision making was not as crisp,” longtime Kleiner partner Ted Schlein said on the stand Friday. “We needed to make hard decisions and ask people to move on, as we got smaller. And we made those decisions with Trae [Vassallo], Chi-Hua [Chien], and Amol [Deshpande].” Doerr corroborated Schlein’s account of the layoffs in his testimony today. “We downsized. When it came time to organize KPCB 16, we made it a smaller fund.” He referred to Deshpande, Pao, and Vassallo’s departures as “transitions” initiated and facilitated by the firm. “We helped Mr. Chien move on also,” he said. Indeed, the trial has revealed the lengths that firms like Kleiner go to to ensure that its tough times are kept quiet and provide soft landings for people in its network. Vassallo, Deshpande, and Chien all remain listed under the “Team” section on Kleiner’s website as strategic advisors, and the firm has also invested in seed funds started by both Chien and former Kleiner partner Aileen Lee. And though Kleiner’s trial defense is centered largely around its assertion that Ellen Pao’s failure to advance at the firm was because she lacked skills as an employee, the way that Kleiner ultimately dismissed her could be mistaken for a promotion — that is, to someone not familiar with the ways of VC. Court evidence presented last week showed that Pao’s termination came in the form of a gently worded “separation agreement” advising her that she would not be advancing to a senior partner role. In the memo, Kleiner Perkins detailed that she’d continue to receive a base salary of $33,333.33 per month for the next six months, receive up to $200,000 in additional payments if she did not find another job in the following months, and still be eligible for a bonus. It’s not only former staffers that receive nice perks. Doerr frequently writes letters of recommendation and makes personal phone calls advocating for university admissions and job offers for those in Kleiner’s extended family. “There are few things we can do that matter more than helping a friend’s spouse, son, or daughter get an opportunity which changes their lives,” Doerr wrote in an email shown in court evidence today. It’s really no surprise that those in VC’s upper echelons live in a privileged world. But it is still fascinating to see the extent of the privilege, how people benefit from it, and the privacy in which it normally dwells. It cannot be overstated that none of this is unique to Kleiner Perkins. All investment firms, and private organizations in general, go through their ups and downs — and often succeed in keeping a stiff upper lip to the outside world. Those in Silicon Valley especially are known to work hard to maintain a reputation of “ killing it ,” even when the reality is much more rocky. The only difference is that because of this court case, the gap between the reality of Kleiner Perkins’ low point, and its public representation in that time, is being shown for all to see. This could provide an important learning opportunity that might just help encourage venture capital firms and the wider tech community to have more transparency from the get-go. After all, as the old saying goes, you’re only as sick as your secrets: The more that you obscure, the more is at risk if and when you are exposed. If the end result of the Kleiner Perkins trial is a more honest and open Silicon Valley, well, that would be a silver lining to an otherwise very dark case.

"Playboy Unwraps Its Online Game Plans With Bigpoint

 Apparently, running pictures of naked women on its web site isn’t a big  enough draw for Playboy Enterprises . Now the company is going to post video  games on its site as well.  Playboy Enterprises said today it is diving into a video games  alliance with German online game publisher Bigpoint. Bigpoint will help  Playboy create games for distribution on Playboy.com. The first  game that will be posted on the Playboy site is Bigpoint’s urban crime game, Poisonville (pictured above), an action-oriented massively multiplayer online game in a  fictional city where crime and corruption rule. In the game, players  will discover “beautiful, Playboy-caliber women.”  Playboy’s new video game publishing label will launch more formally  at the end of 2010 with games that target Playboy’s primary demographic  of 18-year-old to 35-year-old men. It’s one more example of how web  sites want to get users more engaged by offering them addictive  entertainment such as games. Playboy has had other forays into video games, but it is frequently criticized on that front for selling sex to kids; that’s why the company has targeted adult men with its games such as Playboy: The Mansion, in past years .  “One of our core competencies involves using our brand to present  quality content,” Paul Lee of Playboy told PaidContent. “Gaming is a  growing, mainstream area. And part of our plan is to extend Playboy’s  brand into the mainstream.”  Playboy isn’t saying how much it will spend on games, but it says the  financial commitment is significant. The games will be ad-supported for  now, but many of Bigpoint’s games are free-to-play, where gamers can  play for free and pay real money for virtual goods such as better  weapons.  Bigpoint is partially owned by the Peacock Equity Fund, the venture  arm of NBC Universal, as well as U.K.-based private equity firm GMT  Communications Partners. One of its big titles in the works is  Battlestar Galactica. Bigpoint isn’t well known in the U.S., but it has  more than 135 million players in 25 languages. The Hamburg,  Germany-based company has 500 employees. Chicago-based Playboy has been  in a bit of a drama as it tries to figure out its future as either a  public or private company.

"Adapteva Uses Crowdfunding To Raise Money For A $99 Supercomputing Platform

  Adapteva is launching a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter so that it can create a $99 supercomputer for the masses.  The move is a last-ditch funding effort for an ambitious team that at first tried to create a 64-core supercomputing chip for smartphones that would have been the most energy-efficient computing platform on Earth. It’s also an attempt to create a movement around cheap and open hardware that fans can bring into production via their own enthusiasm.  Adapteva wants to raise $750,000 or more for a project dubbed Parallela. It will be tough. Lexington, Mass.-based Adapteva wasn’t able to raise more than its $2.5 million in seed funding to date. So it has turned to Kickstarter, where it hopes to start a community of people who will promote parallel computing on a variety of platforms.   “We quickly discovered that selling disruptive technology to large businesses is very difficult,” said Andreas Olofsson, chief executive of Adapteva, in an interview with VentureBeat. “They move very slowly. We felt like we didn’t want to wait anymore.”  He added, “We think a lot of people want this technology. We are going straight to the customer, straight to the developer, straight to the university. To do that, we have to bring the price down to about $99.”  In doing so, Adapteva is following fan-hyped hardware companies like Rasberry Pi , the credit-card sized computer that can play games like Quake.  “We like to see what happens and how jazzed people get when hardware gets cheap enough and open,” Olofsson said.  Adapteva has designed a pair of chips that have the performance of a supercomputer in a tiny space. The 16-core chip uses an older 65-nanometer process and could be sold for $99, while a 64-core chip using a 28-nanometer process could be sold for $199. These chips have the equivalent of 16 or 64 brains working in parallel, in contrast to most PCs that operate on anywhere from one to four cores.  The problem is that most programmers aren’t skilled in programming lots of cores operating in parallel.  To address that, Adapteva is also creating an open platform with open software that will enable anyone to learn parallel programming in C++, at any level of expertise.  Linley Gwennap, chip analyst and head of the Linley Group, a chip market analyst firm, said in an interview that Adapteva has proven itself on the technical front with its prototype chips. The performance is impressive because it focuses solely on math-intensive operations known as floating point operations. But to make a complete system, you also need to have a central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics chip. That means instead of two major computing systems (the CPU and the GPU), computer makers would have to have three major systems (CPU, GPU, and Adapteva chip) — and that may be what chip makers are balking at, Gwennap said.  “They have done some smart things and focused on this one thing,” Gwennap said. “But you have to pair it with something else to make a full computer.”  Adapteva was founded in 2008 and it has five employees. Competitors include the likes of Nvidia, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Tilera. But Adapteva says it has created a design with extremely low power consumption. While it is hopelessly outnumbered, Adapteva has done the impossible, designing four generations of chips to date at a fraction of the usual cost. (It often takes $50 million or more to bring a modern semiconductor chip to market, using a team of dozens or sometimes even hundreds.)  The company used the low-cost approach of creating the design that it would license out to other chip makers, similar to the way chip designer ARM works. But the approach was so novel that nobody really wanted to take a risk on it.  “This Kickstarter is kind of a last resort,” Olofsson said. “Kickstarter is a great choice because it allows us to bypass all the gatekeepers. We’ll let the market decide if anybody wants this or not.”  The Kickstarter money will be used toward bringing down the production costs of the chips by ordering more wafers. Right now, the chips have to be built in contracted chip factories on wafers where Adapteva’s chips have to share space with other chips. The cost for those chips is $200, but the cost with higher volumes can come down as low as $2 per chip.  Adapteva created its first 65-nanometer Epiphany prototype in 2009 and it raised a first round of funding from BittWare in November 2009. It created its 16-core chip in May, 2010, and did a second version of that in December. It shipped 65-nanometer chips in May, 2011, but found it hard to find customers.  We wrote about Adapteva a year ago and it has recently completed its latest prototype, a 64-core, 28-nanometer chip, in August. That chip is expected to have 70 gigaflops of performance while consuming a single watt of power. Olofsson said that Adapteva got the power of its chip much lower by tossing a lot of things out. The chip won’t run a full operating system such as Linux; rather, it functions as a companion chip, or co-processor, sitting alongside an Intel or ARM-based microprocessor.  Researchers are the first target market for the initial, board-level computer from Adapteva. Then, if it catches on, the chip could be used in a wide range of mobile-focused markets, including running applications for machine vision, radar, speech recognition, software defined radio, security and medical diagnostics. Adapteva itself isn’t doing its own applications. It is hoping the Kickstarter campaign will galvanize more third-party app development.  “It could be used by anyone who is interested in parallel programming,” Olofsson said.  Several military vendors have used the Adapteva chip and dozens of other organizations have been evaluating it. Several universities (Northeastern, MIT, Baylor University) have projects based on the technology. But the Kickstarter program is a way to expand and bring this technology to a lot more people, Olofsson said.  Gwennap said that the hobbyist community alone won’t be a big enough market for the chip. But it could be a stepping stone to getting larger chip makers to pay attention and adopt the architecture.  Prior to starting Adapteva, Olofsson was a contributor to a number of successful chip design projects at Analog Devices, including the TigerSharc digital signal processor family of chips. He also was the architect of a line of charge coupled device controllers for digital still cameras. That family of products sold more than $100 million.

"Mediaspike Reaches 20M Monthly Users With Product Placement In Social-Mobile Games

 MediaSpike brings product placement — like the branded soda cans you see in movies — into social and mobile games. And the company is reporting new progress on its mission today.  Above: MediaSpike ad Image Credit: MediaSpike  The company is announcing that it now reaches more than 20 million monthly unique users with its ad business, which places product advertisements inside mobile and social games. So if you visit a vending machine in a game, you may be able to purchase a virtual Mountain Dew soda.  In June, MediaSpike reached just 1 million monthly uniques. In the five months since, it has grown rapidly and added mobile-social game publishers including Tetris Online, Big Blue Bubble, Bigpoint Games, and Meez.  MediaSpike is also announcing that it has hired digital advertising leaders Calvin Wong and Joe O’Brien. Wong, a former ad sales exec at places like Community Connect and Appsavvy, will be chief revenue officer. O’Brien is the new director of strategic partnerships. He was previously in business development for Appsavvy.  Gokul Rajaram, a former member of the Google team that developed AdSense and is now product engineering lead at Square, has joined as an adviser. Another new adviser is Brandon Berger, the worldwide chief digital officer at the Ogilvy & Mather ad agency.  MediaSpike believes its ads work for today’s users. It’s hard to get gamers to pay attention to banner ads in mobile apps or social games. The company calls this “banner blindness.” But MediaSpike creates ads that players notice because it inserts them into the middle of games. It is part of the gaming experience, like the beer sign pictured above. You can imagine that the sign could be a Pepsi logo instead, and the customer at the bar could be buying a Pepsi.  Blake Commagere, a pioneer of early social games such as Vampires , founded the company. He created MediaSpike in 2011 and raised an undisclosed amount of money from Raptor Capital, CMEA, 500 Startups, Venture51, EchoVC, and HNK Ventures. Chief operating officer John McCrea joined in 2012.  Back in the spring of 2007, Commagere was a 30-year-old veteran of viral marketing and a veteran of early social firm Plaxo, where he met the now-billionaire Sean Parker. Commagere saw that Facebook was about to open up its applications programming interface to third-party developers, and he began experimenting with apps that could spread to as many users as possible. He created memorable apps such as Zombies and Vampires. Those apps were played by more than 50 million users, a huge number given Facebook’s relatively small audience at the time.

"Headspace Releases New Version Of Its Meditation Platform

Headspace is a web and mobile meditation platform that allows you to cram 10 to 60 minutes of calm and clarity into each day of your over-connected and fast-paced life. The company is releasing a new version today, after reaching over 1 million users in 150 countries. I have been a daily user of Headspace for six months now, and it’s interesting to see how technology can help when it comes to meditation. Now, meditation is still an unfamiliar skill for most people. Do you think meditation means cross-legged sitting and chakras opening? I am Parisian, which means that I’m completely blasé , cynical and skeptical. When one of my friends introduced me to Headspace, I couldn’t help but snigger: “another I-drink-carrot-and-ginseng-juice-every-morning Californian hipster thing.” He answered: “Well, first, the startup is based in London. Second, I think you kind of need it.” So I forgot about my assumptions, put my cynicism away and looked into it. The on-boarding experience convinced me right away. From the first second, you’re walked through very short videos that explain how meditation works and what you should expect from it — this one sold it to me. There’s a thousand reasons why you might want to look into meditation — maybe you need to be able to go to sleep at night, to be less stressed out in your day-to-day activities, to free yourself from an addiction and more. For me it boils down to living a happier and more mindful life. With Headspace, you learn to do just that, by taking 10 to 60 minutes out of each day. During this time, Andy Puddicombe will guide you by simply telling you what to do, what to focus on, and what are the mechanisms in play. Puddicombe is one of the founders of Headspace. I like to think of him as Buddha 2.0. On the one hand, he’s bald and lived 10 years as a monk in the Himalayas, Burma, India and Nepal. On the other hand, he and his co-founder Richard Pierson built a beautiful web and mobile platform to demystify meditation and make it accessible to anyone around the globe. Puddicombe’s teaching goes beyond the 10-minute meditation sessions: all the principles you learn from him are applicable in everyday situations, and therein lies the true power of meditation. After a week of meditation, I was already able to step back and cope with unpleasant or complex situations in a far better way, ranging from not getting upset when the suburban train is late (which happens all the time in Paris) to staying rather sane when in just one week I quit my job, gave up my Parisian apartment and flew to New York without a return flight. The idea of Headspace came quite naturally: Puddicombe was travelling around the world teaching meditation with the complete monk attire, robes and bells and stuff. A company he was working with in Russia told him that it saw a direct benefit in teaching meditation to their employees, but that it might be best to adopt a more occidental fashion to do so. He then met his co-founder Pierson, who directly saw the potential of mediation by making it scalable through a beautifully designed web and mobile platform, and Headspace was born in 2010. Meditation is on the rise. Everyday, a few more friends tell me that they’ve begun meditating, I find more press on the subject, and Headspace’s user base is growing at a clip of 20 percent per month. Andy’s reading of this phenomenon is that neuroscience has proven the benefits of this practice on the brain . Meditation isn’t an arcane tradition anymore, but a method recommended by scientists, doctors and therapists. Interestingly, Headspace’s users are almost split equally between men and women (respectively 45 percent and 55 percent) and touches very broad age groups — the company’s youngest users are 4- or 5-year-old children learning meditation with their parents, and the oldest user is 92 years old. Today, Puddicombe and Pierson are releasing version 2 of Headspace, which globally offers the ability to personalize your meditation journey with programs that best fit your needs. There are four main categories: Foundation, Health, Relationships, Performance. I had the chance to access a preview of this new version and was impressed at how much new content was available and how well it integrates with specific situations: with this version 2, you’ll have access to special programs to meditate on-the-go, while commuting or eating for example. You can get a feel of Headspace for free during ten days. After that, if you’re convinced — as I was — and want to dig deeper into it, several subscription plans are available: between £3.74 and £8.95 per month, or a one time plan of £249.85 for unlimited access forever. There’s also a “Headspace SOS” mode that I can’t wait to test in real life moments — in this section you will find two-minute sessions for meltdown moments. Other features simply make meditation easier — you can effectively track your progress, and create emulation, by following your friends’ progress directly through the app. Headspace gives you access to meditation and all the necessary knowledge to meditate in a smart way. Puddicombe said regarding the new version that “there’s nothing like it out there.” I totally agree.

"Lawdingo, The Startup That Lets You Talk To Lawyers Instantly, Joins Y Combinator

Lawdingo , a startup that connects users with lawyers for online consultations (sometimes instantly), is announcing that it’s part of the current class of startups at Y Combinator . I last wrote about Lawdingo in November . You can browse lawyers on the site based on their expertise and location, and if you find one you like, you can schedule an appointment or in some cases hit the “talk now” button. The goal is to make finding a lawyer more convenient and more affordable. (On the affordability side, many of the lawyers on the site offer free consultations, and since you’re choosing from a broad geographic selection, you can probably find lower rates.) Founder and CEO Nikhil Nirmel told me that he hadn’t expected to get into YC. That might sound like false modesty, except that as a solo, non-technical founder, his situation really is a bit unusual for the incubator – so they must have seen something they really liked. (He’s working with a team in Eastern Europe, but Nirmel is still the only full-time Lawdingo employee in the United States.) There are now more than 450 lawyers on the site. As he put it, “We’ve scaled faster than any law firm.” And the business model is evolving. Originally, Lawdingo charged a subscription fee, but Nirmel said that with the varying marketing budgets between different law firms, as well as the fact that different leads for potential clients had different values, that flat fee didn’t make sense for everyone. Instead, he’s moved towards an auction model, where lawyers bid to have their profiles shown to particular users. Over time, as the amount of lawyers on the site grows, they’ll need to bid higher if they want their profiles to show up on the most popular legal topics.

"Qualcomm Pulls Heartstrings, Explores How Mobile Is Changing Lives (Video)

  Starting things off on an emotional beat during his CES keynote this morning, Qualcomm CEO and chairman Paul Jacobs unveiled a series of videos that show how mobile devices are changing the lives of people all over the world.  The videos feature people from all walks of life — from a hip and well-connected techie in New York City, to a fisherman in India. Qualcomm also explores how mobile is helping with personal healthcare and with education through the use of tablets.  Yes, it’s blatant self-promotion for Qualcomm, since its mobile chipsets power the devices used by the video subjects, but it’s still nice to see some positive uses of technology. It’s an especially good counterpoint to mainstream media stories that often center too much on how technology is damaging society.

"Blizzard Won’T Commit To Diablo 3 Release Date This Year

 Blizzard Entertainment chief executive Mike Morhaime said today the company is still not committing to a 2011 release date for Diablo 3, one of its most hotly anticipated titles.  “Diablo 3 is still on track to go into external beta testing this quarter. We’re working hard to ship the game by the end of the year,” Morhaime said on the company’s quarterly earnings call. “But we can’t commit to a release date for the game yet.”  Blizzard Entertainment is letting Battle.net account holders opt in to a limited beta for the game. We earlier reported that the company was just about ready to pull the trigger for a beta program .  The last Diablo game came out in 2000 and still boasts a big player base. It’s nothing compared to Blizzard Entertainment’s most popular online role-playing game, World of Warcraft, which has around 11.4 million subscribers. But the game’s hack-and-slash and loot-seeking formula proved to be popular for more than a decade. It even inspired a number of dungeon crawler copycats like Torchlight .  The Diablo games allow anywhere from two to eight players to jump into discrete games with randomly generated dungeons. The goal is to prevent the forces of Hell from taking over the world by defeating Diablo, the lord of terror, and his cohorts. Players chase after powerful items and weapons to use against other enemies and players or for trade.  The company has unveiled a new player class for Diablo 3 at its annual gaming convention Blizzcon, including the final class at last year’s convention . Diablo has taken somewhat of a backseat to Blizzard Entertainment’s larger game, World of Warcraft, and its newest release Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty.

"With Polagram, Print Photos From Your Phone In Just A Few Taps

French startup Polagram just released a couple of new features and raised a round of funding. You can use the iPhone or Android app to print your photos directly from your phone and receive your prints a few days after ordering them. The app tries to get out of the way as much as possible, it’s just the missing link between your camera roll and your printed photos. The company raised $700,000 (€500,000) from multiple French and American business angels who work or used to work for Voyage Privé, Price Minister, Orange, Fnac and more. The startup is also part of TheFamily . “We had this idea of printing photos from your mobile,” co-founder and CEO Jeremy Charoy told me in a phone interview. “I took photos of my grandmother’s birthday in 2009 or 2010. At the time, you could use Hipstamatic, but it didn’t work well. The problem was still there in 2012, so we decided to launch Polagram.” At first, the company only had one product, 10x10cm-square prints. But everything was still manual — the company was doing things that don’t scale . The team had to ride a Vélib bike with a USB key to their favorite printer, and put the photos in the envelopes themselves. The company then added a new 10x13cm format for full size iPhone photos and a Polaroid-style format with white borders. It also signed a deal with a photo laboratory to automate the printing process. This way, the company could focus on the user experience and business development. That’s why Polagram just launched two new products — a 26-page hardcover book and a collage poster. “Our goal is that you can make a book in less than three minutes on your phone,” Charoy said. I played a bit with the app, and it’s true that the ordering process is fast. You select your product, select photos from your camera roll, Facebook or Instagram accounts, enter your address and payment information and you’re done. A photo costs $0.45, a poster $28, a book $35. While you can order from nearly anywhere in the world, the company is working on deals with local photo laboratories to improve shipping. For example, it recently signed a deal with a German laboratory and is currently looking for an Asian partner. Now, there are eight people working on Polagram, with most of the team based in Nancy, France. Polagram’s competitors include full-fledged photo companies, such as Shutterfly or PhotoBox . But these companies aren’t focused on providing the best mobile experience. It’s still too early to say whether there is enough room in the market for Polagram. Yet, now that most people use their phones as their primary cameras, printing photos should be as easy as switching apps.

"Cogent Health, Maker Of Healthcare It Systems, Raises $3M

 Cogent Health Solutions , a Vancouver-based provider of computerized systems for managing cancer care, raised $3 million in its first funding round. Yaletown Venture Partners led the deal, joined by angel investors.  Cogent’s Web-based system aims to help cancer, nutrition and counseling specialists better manage the long-term care of cancer survivors, who often face daunting health and lifestyle challenges following cancer treatment that frequently includes surgery and toxic radiation or chemotherapy. The system is designed to track patients regarding follow-up treatment, signs of cancer recurrence, long-term side effects of cancer therapy and quality of life.  Cogent says it is preparing to launch the system with “major U.S.-based healthcare providers,” and it will be interesting to see which big insurers agree to make what is undoubtedly a significant investment for a niche patient population. One of the main problems in adoption of healthcare IT is the fact that return on the investment in terms of healthcare cost savings can take a long time to materialize, and often may flow to other providers if the patient population “churns” frequently. Cogent appears to be betting that their system will offer a substantial improvement to the quality of care for cancer survivors, to the extent that it might convince patients to stay put when they might otherwise change health plans. I’m something of a skeptic on that point, but that would make it no less interesting to be proven wrong.  The company’s announcement is here (hat tip: VentureWire ).

"Shin Megami Tensei: A Guide For The Uninitiated

 Editor’s note:  I’ve only dabbled in the Shin Megami Tensei series. I remember Andrew Fitch discussing it with me once in the former copy desk bullpen at Ziff Davis, but my stomach rumbled, and I bailed to find some lunch. Hey, you try editing reviews on an empty stomach! Jeremy finally explains SMT it a way that I understand. Has this enticed you to check it out? -Jason   After hearing the hype surrounding the Shin Megami Tensei series, you’ve finally decided to take the plunge by playing the games. That’s great! But before you do, know that the SMT games are not created equal nor is their gameplay identical. The most popular role-playing-game series of Japanese developer and publisher Atlus’s stable does have many common threads, such as demons based on actual myths as both enemies and allies, fusion of said demons, the cycle of the destruction and rebirth of the world, and Kazuma Kaneko’s striking art style.  But how each of these games go about putting these elements together can be vastly different. Atlus has released 14 SMT games in the U.S., 11 of which are currently available in stores. Because of this, it can be overwhelming to choose which games to start with. Well, worry not, because we’re here to help.  The Gateway Drug  The Digital Devil Saga games are structured the most like traditional Japanese RPGs. You have a party of characters, who each gain their own abilities through a progression system similar to Final Fantasy 10 ’s sphere grid. That’s not the only similarity the Digital Devil Saga games share with FF10. Game progression is fairly linear, and the story is fleshed out with fully voiced cut-scenes.  In other words, it has all the qualities and niceties most JRPG fans are accustomed to wrapped up in a nice SMT package. Many of the recurring demons in the series make appearances here as enemies. The battle system is a nice and simple introduction to a concept that appears in almost every SMT game: Exploiting weaknesses gives you an advantage in battle besides extra damage.  Perhaps the most notable thing, however, is what the games do not have: demon fusion. The game casts aside this feature, found in nearly every other SMT game, to make way for the individual-character-progression system, making the game more accessible for new players. It’s a traditional PS2 JRPG in the SMT style, and this makes for a great way to get into the series.    The Baseline  A traditional take on the latter-day JRPG is fine, but those who want to get to the nitty-gritty of what the series is about will want to play Nocturne . It’s easy to lose track of all the subseries roaming around out in retail land, but Nocturne is, in fact, the third part of the actual main SMT series. Everything associated with the series is here. Cataclysmic events that cause the upheaval of the world and demons to appear? Check. Demon fusion integral to progressing through the game? Check. An oppressive atmosphere and challenging battles? Checkaroony. The game also allows you to negotiate with demons to get out of battles, receive gifts, or even recruit them. It’s all here, and it’s all great.  However, a word of caution: Don’t expect a lot of the niceties that you see in modern JRPGs. The concept of towns as safe zones is almost completely absent from this game. Battles can happen nearly anywhere. And you’ll want to put thoughts of grinding right out the window, because leveling up a team of your favorite demons is not going to get you to the end. You’ll need to continually fuse them to progress. And those luxuries known as cut-scenes and voice acting? Forget it. One could make an argument that the game is archaic. But what that doesn’t account for is that every piece of design found in this game is deliberately placed to work in its favor. Gameplay and atmosphere have a symbiotic relationship, creating an amazing, foreboding experience. Nocturne is a masterpiece through and through and once you’re done with this one, you can appreciate the different ways this formula branched out from here once you continue on your SMT journey.  The Innovators  Persona 3 and Persona 4 both have the most name recognition of the SMT games in the U.S., and for good reason: They both received the most critical buzz out of all the SMT games to make the States. Word of mouth also helped make these games two of the most financially viable in the series. But what sets them apart from the rest of the pack? For one thing, the setting is not a dystopian future divorced from our own reality. The setting is modern-day Japan and center around high schoolers. This is not the usual “teens set out on an epic journey and save the world” story. They may save worlds in the end, but the entire game takes place in the same city or town. Not only that, but the game makes you go through the day of a normal high schooler.  This all serves a purpose, as the relationships you develop in the schools and neighborhoods actually strengthen the demons you fuse for your afterschool activity: facing demons in a strange alternate world. In addition, the battle system feels like a mixture of Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy X-2 : Each demon you equip gives you unique battle abilities, and you can change that demon on the fly.  On paper, it sounds weird and Japanese, and in a way, that’s exactly what it is. In practice, all of these things work really well together. Everything feels like it takes place in a natural sequence. And the regular parts of your day are as engrossing as the extracurricular activities. It is a vastly different take on JRPG structure that succeeds because it is both unique and compelling.  Version Alert: Persona 4 currently comes in one version, but Persona 3 has seen several iterations since it came out. For those who want their RPG experiences on consoles, the Persona 3: FES is currently the most complete and value-packed version of the game, stuffing the original game with extras and adding a new epilogue. For those who want their Persona 3 on the go, the portable version is set to hit the States sometime this year. It makes some concessions for the PSP but adds a new female main character as as well as new interactions to match the new character.  The History Lesson  With all the recent positive buzz given to the Persona series, it may surprise many just how different the original game is. Recently ported to PSP, Persona contains none of the social integration. It’s structured more like a traditional JRPG: go to location, get through dungeon, kill boss, and repeat. You traverse dungeons in first-person navigation, with an abundance of dead ends with nothing in them. While SMT games were never at the cutting edge of graphical power, this game very much screams its PS origins to the top of its lungs.  To top all that off, the fusion system here, unsurprisingly, just isn’t as polished or balanced as its later counterparts. But those who can stomach all that should find a surreal adventure in this game. The battle system, while hampered a bit by the fusion system, is still fairly engrossing, sporting a surprisingly robust demon-negotiation system that even rivals the contemporary entries. The game does not reach the dizzying heights of the rest of the series, but those who give it a chance will find a quality game.  Version Alert: The recent PSP release is the definitive version, polishing the graphics, adding much-needed save points, and most importantly, bringing back content that was cut — namely, the Snow Queen quest, a divergent path through the game.  The Comedy  All of the SMT games have fairly grim undertones, so having a more lighthearted take on the formula is nice. Enter the PS2 Devil Summoner games. The setting is 1920s Japan, where they dial back the foreboding and create a substantial mystery that doesn’t take itself too seriously. The battle system further distances Devil Summoner from its siblings. Rather than being turn-based, the random battles are all action-oriented; you attack with your sword and your demon partners’ powers. It’s a nice change of pace for those already entrenched in the admittedly dreary world of SMT.  One final thing you should be aware of: If you only play one of the two Devil Summoner games, play the second. It contains many improvements over the original that change the overall experience. The prerendered backgrounds of the first game’s battles are fully 3D fields in the second game. It also gives you a second demon partner, changing the flow of battles. Finally, the second game sports an improved version of Nocturne’s negotiation mechanics, further changing how battles play out. Because of this, the second game is almost a lighthearted Nocturne with an action bent.  The Strategy  The PS2 Devil Summoner games veered off the beaten path of turn-based games, but Devil Survivor skews even more into unfamiliar territory. Though Atlus has released SMT SRPGs in Japan, this is the first sent to the U.S., and it’s far from conventional. You still do battle on turn-based grids, but each unit is actually a team of a demon tamer and two demons, which you acquire through an auction (but it lack demon fusion). When you get to an encounter between two teams, a short Dragon Quest -like battle takes place for a turn or two depending on what weaknesses were hit.  The adventure structure is also different as you pick locations that have events to move the story forward. Doing them moves the clock forward in time, meaning you can’t do everything. You have to pick and choose how the story unfolds. Since it has are six different endings, all the things you do are important, which is key. Each playthrough has the potential to be quite different. And while the premise of being trapped in a segment of Tokyo for a week has been done before in The World Ends With You , the execution is fresh here. Both SRPG fans and those looking for a different take on the genre should check it out.  And don’t be scared away by the horrible character art. It is indeed awful, but the game itself offsets this.  The Black Sheep  Perhaps the most maligned of the modern-day SMT games, Imagine , the free-to-play MMORPG set in the SMT universe, wasn’t even developed by Atlus. Cave, makers of bullet-hell shoot-em-ups such as DoDonPachi , made it. In theory, it sounds great. Take your demons in a persistent world and play both with and against other players. It also has all the usual SMT trappings. You can negotiate with the demons to become battle partners, it has different alignments and groups to those alignments, and it takes place in a dystopian world.  But the very qualities of an MMO hamper the ability to provide an SMT-like experience. You can’t carefully guide the experience to maximize the atmosphere. In fact, the atmosphere is on no one’s lips when it comes to this game. The environments are both sterile and uninspired. Finally, something’s just not right about the main point of an SMT game being the loot grind. Still, it’s not a complete loss. The game itself, divorced from the heavy burden of the SMT legacy, ends up being just another MMO, meaning you will either enjoy the mechanics enough to play it or you won’t. And since it’s free, little’s stopping you from finding out for yourself.  The Coming Attraction  But wait, there’s more! Or, rather, soon there will be. Coming out at the end of March, Strange Journey picks up the torch where Nocturne left off. Billed as carrying the spirit of the mainline series, it brings things back to classic SMT style, taking place in first-person dungeons similar to those found in the first two mainline games, but carrying with it everything learned from the third game. Atlus has been taking a shine to first-person RPGs as of late with the Etrian Odyssey series, Class of Heroes , The Dark Spire , and the Persona PSP port. Strange Journey looks to top them all and provide an incredible experience for both first-person RPG fans and SMT fans.  The Extra Credit  It isn’t currently available in stores, but Persona 2 is generally lauded as being a high point for PS1 RPGs. It essentially heavily refines the rather large potential that Persona contained and delivers. The weird part is that Atlus divided it into two separate games, Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment. However, the U.S. only got the latter. The kicker is that Persona PSP sold incredibly well in Japan, so it would seem like a Persona 2 rerelease would be a no-brainer. No news on this, though, so the original release is well worth tracking down.  (Images from 1UP.com )

"First Day Of Sales For Iphone 7 And Apple Watch 2 Still Draws Lines Of Fans Around The World

 The scenes may not be as massive or boisterous as in the early days, but even after nine years of iPhones, you can count on some hardcore Apple fans to line up in advance of the first day of sales.  Today is that day, and Apple Stores in Asia and Australia have already opened with the new iPhone 7 ( though not the iPhone 7 Plus ) and Apple Watch 2.

"Book Summary App Blinkist Rolls Out Globally

 Blinkist , the Berlin-based startup that distills key insights from non-fiction books into nugget-sized summaries, has today launched its app globally. It is now available on iOS and the web.  “With Blinkist, we want to free the knowledge that is hidden in so many books,” said Blinkist CEO and cofounder Holger Seim. Access to Blinkist’s library of bite-sized overviews — which includes Noam Chomsky’s Rogue States and Christopher Hitchen’s God Is Not Great — is free for the first month. After that, users have to pay $4.99 per month.  The company was founded by Heim, Niklas Jansen, Sebastian Klein, and Tobias Balling in 2012. A statement by Blinkist explains that summaries are not generated by algorithms, instead “every book is hand-picked and written by experts — pure human brainpower with a passion for explaining complex matters with simple and beautiful language”.  Naturally, this leads to a number of questions: Are users shelling out money to essentially read someone else’s summarised interpretation of the book? Who are these writers and why should we trust their ability to read a book properly?  While we can (sort of) understand Blinkist’s goal of helping busy people consume information efficiently, do authors and publishers share a similar sentiment?  “They are cautious, but in general open-minded about the idea. We closed the first contracts with two large German publishers, but unfortunately due to legal restrictions we can’t talk about the details just yet. At the same time we are talking to a few other publishers,” responded Seim.

"How Early Access And Fan Feedback Led To Amplitude Studios’ ‘Endless’ Success

 Digital storefronts, Steam’s Early Access program, crowdfunding, and community involvement have led to a renewed PC gaming market, one in which opportunity abounds for both established developers, new enterprises, and indie studios.  The French strategy-game outfit Amplitude Studios is one of a legion of game companies that has taken advantage of these new models. Fan feedback influenced all three of its releases: Endless Space, Endless Legend, and Dungeon of the Endless. Legend and Dungeon were both in Early Access, and Amplitude made tweaks as players found bugs and other issues with the titles. This not only helped the games sell well but also earn respectable reviews on Metacritic.  To learn more about this new era of development — and how it’s helping turn Amplitude into a success — GamesBeat spoke with the studio’s CEO Mathieu Girard and creative director/chief operating officer Romain de Waubert.  (And yes, we also learned how How a ‘beer-together’ factored into Amplitude’s Endless strategy games development.)  Here is part two of the interview.  GB: What do you find is the strongest region for your games as far as sales?  Romain De Waubert and Mathieu Girard: The U.S.  De Waubert: If you take North America as a whole, it’s something like 45 percent. Canada plus the U.S.  GB: Here in the United States, we tend to think that Eastern Europe is the big, thriving market for strategy games.  Above: Amplitude Studios’ chief operating officer Romain de Waubert. Image Credit: Amplitude Studios  De Waubert: It is, definitely. It’s a big region for us. But the thing is, there are two ways of looking at it. You can look at units and you can look at revenue. The U.S and Canada are the biggest one for both. In terms of units, eastern Europe is very interesting as well, but the problem that we have is—We knew we were small and we had to focus. Therefore we decided to work in English. English is the first language we used in development. Our writer is an American. Everything is written in English first. Our communication with the community is in English. If you want to penetrate some territories, first you need to speak in their language. That’s where we’re still too small. You can see that we’re very strong in all the territories where English is the first language, or the Nordic countries where most people speak English well.  GB: Your business model is pretty much PC development, then Early Access, then release. How important is Early Access to you?  De Waubert: Huge. Again, it’s something Mathieu and I knew we wanted to do early on. We wanted to create, before we even heard this name for it, through live development. We wanted to work live, in front of the players. They wouldn’t just be an audience. They could be actors in the game’s development. We could create games together. But for that, they need to be able to play the game before it’s finished. Also, this ties to some past development experiences we’ve had, where it was only when the game shipped that knew it had some flaws. We could have fixed those if we knew about them early on. It’s so frustrating to find out about something like that after a game has shipped. That’s why we’re so happy to be able to share the game early in development. We still focus on making the game as complete as we can when we share it with the community. But it’s restricted somewhat in scope.  GB: With Early Access, what do you feel is more important? Is it the feedback you get to make your games better or the revenue you get to help make it better?  Above: Amplitude Studios’ CEO Mathieu Girard. Image Credit: Amplitude Studios  Girard : Feedback.  De Waubert: We’re actually fighting a bit with some other developers to try to make them understand that they shouldn’t expect revenue from Early Access. It’s great to have revenue, but the worst thing for a player is to buy a game in Early Access and never see it finished. When that happens once, twice, three times, they’ll never go back to Early Access and that hurts everyone. When we started, first we raised money on our own and then we went to Early Access. Before we went to Early Access, we knew we had enough money to finish the game. Early Access, we didn’t even think about the revenue we would make from that. What we wanted was the feedback – how we could improve the game, how we could make it better, what we missed, how we could make it more interesting, what features could make the game smoother and more enjoyable. Does it work across all machines? And so on. Those are the kinds of things we try to get from our Early Access.  GB: When you’re talking about that feedback, what was the most interesting piece of feedback you got for any of your games, if you recall?  Girard : There’s feedback and then there’s the fact that the community, through the Games Together program, can participate in the creation and addition of content for the game. One example is the Cultist faction we added to Endless Legend, which was designed by the community. One of our fans designed the gameplay and the lore for the faction, and then some artists designed the units, the buildings, the ships, the logos. Based on that, we finalized it and implemented the real gameplay. We made real 3D assets for the units and buildings. We finalized the concept art. But it was very close to what the fans had created on the Games Together forum. It was really impressive, and it was part of the eight factions delivered with the released game last fall.  De Waubert: This is the way we work. Games Together, when we tell them—In a week when we don’t know what to do, we’ll ask them what we should do. We allow them to vote on things we’ll do in that week or during that time. For us it’s difficult not knowing exactly what we’re going to work on at a specific moment, but we know that it’s so interesting for the community to decide for themselves what we’ll work on, what the priorities will be, what it will be like. They feel so much closer to the game’s development. It’s worth leaving a piece of the game to them so they can make it their own.  Girard : We make very complex games, very deep and rich, and it’s amazing to see the help that the fans can bring by giving their opinions on, say, the tuning of a faction. They make amazing reports with lots of detail. We can use that to check against the code and improve the game. It has a huge value for us.  De Waubert: Mathieu and I, we both worked on strategy games before, but we never worked on 4X games. That scared us a bit. We were big fans of 4X, but we weren’t 4X developers. That’s why we needed Early Access. We needed to attract some of the best 4X players in the world so they could help us and share with us what they need, what they like, and how to tune the game by playing and improving it. Without them we would never have reached this level of quality, and for us it’s really all about quality.  Above: Amplitude Studios’ Games2gether portal. Image Credit: Jason Wilson/GamesBeat  GB: On the Games Together page, I see that you have a minor faction hero biography for a character named Markiza in Endless Legend. Your fans, they voted on that?  De Waubert: Yes.  GB: Who wrote this? Was it a player who wrote this, or one of your staffers?  Girard : That was our staff.   1  2  View All

"Mmo Nether Wants To Know How You’D Survive The Apocalypse (Preview)

 Chip Sineni did the best he could as my tour guide. He left his character for a moment to zoom out of the map, showing me just how much destruction the apocalypse had brought to the city. Unfortunately, that meant he wasn’t paying attention when creatures suddenly appeared and attacked him mercilessly until he died. He started over, but they killed him again just a few minutes later. The monsters weren’t backing down.  The director and cofounder of Phosphor Games Studio was trying to show Nether , a first-person massively multiplayer online (MMO) survival game for PC. It takes place 10 years after a mysterious event called The Cull wiped out most of humanity. The few survivors left have to fight for scraps while being chased by nethers, mutated creatures that use teleportation to find you. One of its inspirations is DayZ , a popular and ruthless zombie mod for PC military shooter Arma II (that’s also coming as its own PC game).  Beyond Nether’s basic survival gameplay, however, the developer hasn’t decided what other features it’ll include. That’s where you come in. It’s hoping to gather feedback from the community to find out what they want to see in this kind of MMO.  Above: Safe zones are the only places where you can store your items. Image Credit: Phosphor Games Studio  “We really feel with such a multiplayer-centric game, the community is the best source for what kinds of features are important for them,” Sineni said to GamesBeat. “Historically, developers can spend significant resources building features that players aren’t even asking for. Having the audience keep playing the game is everything — as developers, we need to focus on delivering the features that will keep them playing.”  To help gather those responses, Phosphor Games will have an “early release” (and work-in-progress) version of Nether available for purchase this fall, with a proper launch scheduled for 2014. Here’s what you can expect so far, along with some ideas that Sineni said may or may not make it into the game, depending on what the community wants.  Carving out a place of your own  What I saw Nether takes place in a large, decrepit city that shares some similarities to Chicago, home of Phosphor Games. The wide, empty streets, thick fog, and tall buildings — as high as 20 stories — makes it easy to hide from other players (up to 64 per server). As in DayZ, you have to decide whether you should trust complete strangers and team up with them  or just shoot them first and take their supplies for yourself. Headlines from old newspapers give some hints to what happened 10 years ago, but Phosphor Games mostly want to focus on players creating their own stories.  Since you can enter most buildings on the map, you could try to fortify a room or floor with a well-coordinated team, but that still wouldn’t stop the nethers from teleporting inside. Your best bet for protection is hiding out in safe zones, fortress-like areas where you can store your items. Sometimes, you’ll have to help defend these zones from waves of creatures when the Anti-Nether towers break [ seen in the video below ], and whoever repairs them first gets a money and experience bonus.  You can also buy or trade supplies with players while you’re inside, but nothing is stopping them from ripping you off once they take their payment.  What they might add or change The developer is thinking about fleshing out the fiction more with audio or journal entries and nonplayable characters to talk to. Player-owned spaces are also a possibility, Sineni said, just so you have another area to store your equipment if you’re too far from a safe zone. [youtube http://youtu.be/_qH2DXkIh-M] Fighting back against the nethers  What I saw The nethers come in different shapes and sizes: the Heavy (a “thug-like” nether), Hunter (tracks you), Shrieker (alerts other nethers if they see you), a “Sub boss” (you need multiple people to take it down), and the Broken (brain-dead humans who resisted some of the mutation and won’t attack unless you provoke them). Hunters, the only type in the demo, spawned alarmingly fast and attacked in swarms. Sineni fended off a few of them with a kitchen knife, but they quickly overwhelmed him before he could heal himself with a bandage.  When you die, you lose almost everything in your backpack, keeping only your money and experience points. Guns are available, but they’re not as common as melee weapons.  What they might add or change The team is still deciding how rare guns and bullets will be and whether you can craft items. How frequent the nethers appear also needs tweaking, a number that could increase when night falls (time of day made no difference in this version).  Above: You can climb up most buildings. Image Credit: Phosphor Games Studio  Nether is a change of pace for the developer, who’s best known for the mobile games Horn and The Dark Meadow. Phosphor Games did have a different PC title in the works, the superhero action game Project Awakened, but development halted after two crowdfunding campaigns failed to raise enough money. Phosphor’s “core” team is working on Nether.  “PC players are very open-minded with trying a variety of game genres, and you can sell games cheaper on PC, so more people can try your game out without spending $60,” Sineni said when describing their new emphasis on PC games. “We’d always talk about the kind of game we could make on PC — a lot of our team plays MMOs and multiplayer shooters, and [that] really made us question ‘well why aren’t we just making a PC game?’ Indie devs can’t do a persistent game like Nether on other platforms. PC is really well suited for it.”

"Website Building Tool Jimdo Is Taking Off, Adding Cool Features, Making Money

Jimdo , a service that lets anyone create a good-looking website without too much effort, is on a roll. The tool has now been used to build over 4 million websites, and 200,000 more Jimdo-powered sites get published every month. Last year, the German startup behind the service rolled out a feature that let anyone create an online store , quickly and easily. Fast forward 15 months and 40,000 online stores have been built using the service, generating more than 7.5 million euros in sales. Today, the company is debuting a mobile-friendly view for optimized display on iPhone, Android handsets and other smartphones, which works for all Jimdo websites. In addition, all 40,000 online stores will have a mobile store with mobile checkout. Click a Google Map in the mobile view, and the native Google Maps app will open on your phone. Jimdo has more in store: next week, the company will announce Dropbox integration, enhancing the website building application with a digital file center in the cloud. The startup currently boasts offices in Hamburg, San Francisco, Shanghai, and through cooperation with KDDI Webcommunications, also in Tokyo. There are about 70 people working for Jimdo today, and co-founder Christian Springub just relocated to the United States to more efficiently attack the North American market. Furthermore, Jimdo is a profitable business today, although they declined to share absolute revenue numbers. Either way, their momentum is noteworthy, especially when you consider how much capital was raised by rivals Wix ( $58.5 million ) and Yola ( $25 million ). Jimdo, in contrast, was built on only 500,000 euros (roughly $715,000). When United Internet invested in the company, more capital was available, but the management team actually moved to buy back the shares back in 2009.

"My Health Data Is Killing Me

 We are still in the dark ages when it comes to health and fitness data. It reminds me of the early 1990s when I had a paper day planner for a calendar, a business card holder for contacts, and a map.  Then along came the Microsoft Outlook and LotusNotes platform. These two platforms slugged it out like Uber verses Lyft. Then Microsoft integrated MS Office with MS Outlook and it was “game over.” I finally had one place to find everything I needed to do 90% of my job.  I’m waiting for that moment to come to the realm of my fitness data. It’s extremely difficult for me to access my medical and fitness data as it is, and yet the recent CES conference presented hundreds of new ways to collect more of my data. There will be wearables, scales, patches, contact lenses, smartphones, watches, etc. Maybe even a drone to fly overhead and watch what I eat for lunch. It is overwhelming. How overwhelming, you ask?  Let’s start with AppleHealth (HealthKit).  There is a reason Apple gave this app out for free on iOS 8.0. I recall getting the Brickbreaker game for free on my Blackberry in 2004. I played it once on a long flight and never used it again.  There are so many ridiculous data categories in HealthKit. Note at right that I have to go past my Biological Sex every day — which hopefully doesn’t ever change — to get to my Blood Alcohol Content, which typically does change every day. After Caffeine, there are categories for Calcium, Chromium, Copper, Folate, Iodine, Iron, Molybdenum, etc. I can also track the “Number of times I’ve fallen”, which I guess is useful for some older folks. But how many older folks that fall frequently are using this app on their iPhone? And how many times per year am I gonna check my Molybdenum levels? I don’t even know what a good Molybdenum level is. So I gotta scroll past my Chromium, Copper, and Folate categories to get to my Heart Rate. If I go up a level, I get to Calories, Steps, Walking + Running Distance, and Nike Fuel. The Nike Fuel category is really great, but Nike has fired everyone and is no longer making wearable hardware, so it’s already obsolete.  The majority of the data I collect on personal fitness does not map to Apple HealthKit. So I’m tracking tons of information on multiple apps and sites. Right now, my Apple HealthKit dashboard contains the following data: Steps, Walking Distance, Weight, BMI, Body Fat, Active Calories, and Heart Rate. Like the data coming from wearables, most of this data is totally useless to me. As a reasonably healthy person, I’m not that interested in how many steps I take each day. At 13% body fat, I’m also not that concerned with minor fluctuations in BMI.  In my Bathroom  I use a Withings Smart Body Analyzer. Fancy term for a scale in my bathroom. I weigh myself and that data wirelessly transmits to my Withings iPhone app. With two clicks I can access every weight reading for the last year. It captures my weight, Body Fat, BMI, Heart Rate, Steps, and the Air Quality in my bathroom. This information maps to Apple HealthKit, but it’s just about the only data that is useful that maps directly where it is supposed to go.  At my Doctor  My Primary Care Physician now has my medical records in a secure electronic site using Epic MyChart. At my home page I am reminded to have a Tdap/td Age 18-65. I have no idea what this is, but apparently I’m overdue for it.  My last blood test is there, but there is no history beyond that test. There are lots of cool tools like graphing and trending capabilities, but with one blood test there isn’t much to graph. Luckily I maintain the results of 15 blood tests going back to 1997. It’s a basic MS Excel spreadsheet on my desktop.  Of course, none of this will map to Epic MyChart or AppleHealth unless I manually enter it. So even with all the recent digital advances, I am still comparing my current results from Epic/MyChart to my old Excel spreadsheet. Of course, none of this data maps over to AppleHealth or any other app. So this is pretty much dead data. Once I’ve looked at my blood test results, there is no reason to go back.  I could not find any other test results or images, such as a recent colonoscopy. Maybe that’s a good thing. But what if I have chest pains during an overnight trip to Oklahoma City? How will the emergency department get my last EKG? What if I need an MRI, but I just had one last week in Atlanta? Having a cloud-based repository is not only convenient, it will reduce over-testing and excess cost from the system.  At the Gym  Flywheel Spin Class: The Flywheel app is the most useful app on my phone. It’s tied to the joint where I do spin classes. I use it 4-5 times each week. I can schedule classes, track my performance, average speed, calories burned, distance, etc. Everything maps immediately to my Flywheel iPhone app. I can also graph all my rides against each other back to my first ride in January 2014. I can look at each ride and determine the percentile vs. every other rider in Atlanta. Again, none of this maps to Apple HealthKit.   Polar Beat/Flow: I use Polar Beat/Flow and a chest strap to track my heart rate, distance, calories, exercise zones, etc. when I’m doing aerobic activity. This information does map to a Polar app on my iPhone and then to AppleHealth. In terms of improving my cardiovascular health, this is probably the most useful app. I can actually see (graphically) how hard I’m working and whether my performance is improving. But it is only useful to me at 160 heart beats per minute. For the other 23 hours in the day, it is useless to me.  FitBit: I started using a FitBit activity tracker last December. I made it to about February before I put it in a drawer. My daily steps and calories just aren’t that interesting or useful to me. And I can typically tell you whether I slept okay last night or not. The other features were useless. Surprisingly, it did not allow me to track my heart rate during exercise. This “one-dimensional” wearable category will die unless the diagnostic technology ramps up fast. Even then it will likely become siloed into different devices for chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiac, etc. It will soon be as useful as the hieroglyphics text I used on my old Palm 3 PDA.  The prognosis  The Apple HealthKit app seems haphazardly put together. A beta user could have figured out how useless most of the categories are in a matter of days. Even for a data geek like me who tracks everything, the vast majority of the categories are useless.  Most people think Apple will just be the “repository.” But getting all my apps to sync to Apple HealthKit is frustrating or impossible. If I was a betting man, I’d say that Apple has intentionally created a site that is rather useless. A teaser, of sorts. If the consumer gets frustrated enough they will either give up or go looking for an easier way to collect and aggregate data. It would seem that Apple is merely setting the stage for one device that does it all: the Apple iWatch. After all, there isn’t much profit margin in a free app. There is a high margin in a category killing iWatch.  Then again wearing a geeky smart watch is an invitation to get beat up and stuffed into a school locker during homeroom. The iWatch will never be as cool as the iPod, iPad, or iPhone, even if Steve Jobs personally makes the pitch in a hologram from heaven.  What the world needs now is a category killer like MS Outlook. It needs to be user friendly and have a killer GUI. I need one site where my fitness and my medical data can coexist happily. A place where I don’t have to scroll past my Molybdenum levels to see results from yesterday’s spin class. Where data analytics can begin to predictively model my health risks and let me know when something is wrong. A place where I can begin to control my own data and take proactive steps towards better health. After all, what good is all this data if I cannot use it?  We need the “Domo” of healthcare.

"Plancast Schedules A New Iphone App, Eventbrite Integration, And Local Events

Back in March, on the eve of SXSW, Plancast got an iPhone app out just in time . Now, with more time to work, they’ve perfected it with the launch of version 2. And that’s not all they’ve been working on. Over the past couple of weeks, Plancast has rolled out a new site design, a new plan social invitation system, and Eventbrite integration. On top of that, they’re also testing out two other new features: local plans and a recent activity feed. Each of these features make a great service even better. First off, as I alluded to, the iPhone app is now much improved. Included in this refresh (also made by Leah Culver , who made the first one) is a completely reworked design that cleans up and simplifies the user experience. Also now baked-in is Twitter and Facebook integration to make sharing (and/or signing up) easy. The app is also now iOS 4-ready with Retina display and fast app switching support. The second new aspect of Plancast is the revamped website. Quietly rolled out at the end of last month, sharing plans from the site is now easier than ever thanks to a more Ajax approach. Co-founder Mark Hendrickson (also a TechCrunch alum) notes that the new share plan prompt was inspired by Quora in that it doubles as both a search box and an input box. The hope is that this will cut down on the amount of duplicate plan entries in the system — arguably Plancast’s biggest weak-spot. Plancast has also added Eventbrite integration — a very nice addition for the users of that event registration service. Just as with their Facebook Event integration , Plancast will now automatically pull-in any Eventbrite plans you have and populate them on your Plancast profile. Hendrickson notes that we should probably expect Meetup integration next. A new feature that’s sort of tucked away but may be the slickest one on the site is the cross-site invitations. Now, when you’re setting up a new plan (or inviting people to an existing one) if you simply start typing in the Invite box it will bring up a list of your contacts from not only Plancast, but Twitter and Facebook as well (assuming you’ve hooked up those accounts to your Plancast account). This way, if a friend of yours isn’t using Plancast yet, you can invite them to your event by way of one of those other networks. If you choose their Twitter account, Plancast will tweet at them for you. Or if you choose their Facebook account, Plancast will post on their Wall. “ I haven’t seen anyone do anything like this before, probably because it requires quite a bit of overhead, ” Hendrickson says. What he means by this is that Plancast has to continually cache your friend lists from those service and index them so that they can show results as quickly as they do. Finally, two new features that Plancast is only testing out for now is a new Local tab, and a recent activity feed. The activity feed should be self-explanatory — it will show activity on the site beyond friends simply adding plans. So if a friend comments on a plan or subscribes to a new person, this will show up. The bigger new feature are the local plans. As I said, this is a new tab on the website that allows you to see the events happening around you. This is a great addition for event discovery as it puts public events out there that people in your social graph may not be attending, but still may be of interest to you. “ We’ll be evolving this functionality considerably by letting users filter by popularity and other factors ,” Hendrickson says. You can find the new Plancast iPhone app here . It’s a free download.

But recently we finally got some real news, when Google of all people released Gdrive. We knew of course that it was coming, but not how it would actually feel when it got here. I haven’t signed up yet, but already it’s a big deal for me. I haven’t signed up because the iOS versions are not done, or ready, or whatever imminent means. When they are shipped, I’m there. Gdrive is the kind of disruption that lurks beneath the surface, behind the marketing campaign, irrespective of even Google’s position in the market. It is like Gmail was when it started, a harbinger with real muscle that marks the beginning of something bigger than a single vendor. First of all, it kills Google Docs by inserting those features as menu items in Gdrive. This is a real dagger in Microsoft’s heart, the first direct evidence of a post-document model. Naturally the anklebiters will say documents are not dead, etc. But they are. Where are documents on the iPad? You can get to them through some circituitous route through iTunes or whatever, but really there is no file system exposed to us except at the export level, via email or iCloud or Bluetooth maybe. I kid because Apple is, or has been, serious about this no-USB thing. The only place this has been a problem for me is when I write this column for Techcrunch and come to the add a picture part of the post creation process. If I come in through the WordPress site via the so-called HTML hole (the Web), the only way I can add a graphic to the library is via the file system. You know, file open oh yeah there is no file open. Luckily I’ve discovered a workaround, namely using the WordPress iPad app to add a photo from the Camera Roll. I have no control over placement or the custom settings Techcrunch uses, but I can go back in through the Web and move things around. Now look at what Gdrive did to Google Docs. It basically said: there is no such thing as a word processor, or a spreadsheet, or a presentation program. There are only these triggers here that look like file names, locations in virtual space aka the cloud. When I “write” it goes to the cloud, when I “edit” it comes back from the cloud, when I “share” it is replicated out in multiple similar relationships to the cloud. You could say it’s a document that’s being worked with, or you could say the idea or the image or the communication or the consensus exists as an object composed of data and metadata about how the object works. In other words, the list of things I don’t care about just got longer. I don’t care about the file name, because it is now wrapped in a container that includes the services I can access in addition to the information itself. I don’t care about the metadata, not the names of the people who have access to it or the sharing model that controls that, because it’s dynamic and subject to change as the universe continues to expand or contract or whatever. And I don’t care about the abstraction of the document, the parent object, because all I want to know is what this is about, not how it got here or where it’s going next. The abstraction I do care about is the push notification. Not coincidently, this is an Android feature that Apple has adopted, one in which I am training myself to trust that if I tap on a notification, it will be smart about what services I want to consume it with. A tweet opens to a post, consuming the citation and identifying the social authority to the advantage of my filter process, whether that’s automated or “manual” or self-learning or socially aware. Not only do I not know the filename or the website of the citation or even whether it’s a post or a video or an application trigger, that lack of knowledge is an asset rather than a limitation. I’ve got an app for all of that, or soon will. So when Gdrive takes that same approach and renders the features of Google Office irrelevant, they render Office irrelevant too. This is a lesson I’ve learned from my children, who use texting and Skype for communications and the abstraction of Facebook for email. Email for them is a lot like Word docs are for me; I’ll use them if necessary but prefer not to know what the format is or especially what the document type is or ultimately that it is a document at all. When my youngest comes to dinner, she doesn’t hang up because it’s not a call. She’s got a Mindcraft connection piggybacked on Skype and she just tells them she’s going to have dinner. BRB. Imagine what happens when Gmail gets sucked into the Gdrive vortex. Google has had some problems with this called Buzz and Zap or whatever that Australian thing was (Wave), but Gmail was this thing that was being integrated with other things like social and realtime. Instead, what gets absorbed into Gdrive is the value proposition of Gmail: the idea that you don’t throw anything away, you just find it when or if you need it again. You don’t look for the document, you look for the clues to that idea, that connection, that breadcrumb that leads to the trail of breadcrumbs. I’m writing this on Word on a Mac, and my wife wants to know whether I want to come with her to drop our youngest off at a dance. Right now I have to email this to myself so I can open this up on my iPad if I want to continue. Gdrive should let me store this directly to the cloud, thereby bypassing the need to know any of those details. If I store my Word documents on Gdrive, they should open up on the Mac in Word. Or maybe in Pages on the iPad. Or in WordPress in the post. Right now there are interchange issues, and business issues where Apple wants me to stay in iCloud and Google in Gdrive and Microsoft in whatever Mesh is now called. But I don’t care about any of that, and apps will appear that erase those distinctions, at least from my awareness. I will pay for the value of not knowing. Lots of us will.

"Leaked Ipod Cases Show New Ipod Nano Design

We’ve already seen a few  pieces of the new iPod touch, which, though it may not be a carbon copy of the iPhone 4 minus the phone, it’ll probably follow the example of previous devices in providing similar functionality. The new Nano, though — we’ve had some speculation based on the tiny touchscreen leaked a while back, but I was skeptical of the usability of such a wee thing. But these leaked cases seem to indicate that yes, the new Nano is a tiny, touchable square. The tiny cases suggest a square-faced device with space on the back for a clip. It looks to be the right size for a 3cm square touchscreen, and while my doubts remain about the usefulness of such a thing, it still is a fun idea and I’m excited to see what Apple has done to make it usable. Guess we’ll find out on the first ! [via Electronista ]

"U.S. Music Sales Down As Streaming Up 24% To 51B Tracks In 6 Months; Harlem Shake Bumps Its Way To The Top

As questions continue to swirl around just how well artists get paid through streaming music services like Spotify — and what they can do to improve that — Nielsen today released numbers that attest to how streamed music is rising against a decline in music sales. In the first six months of 2013, streaming music was up by 24% to nearly 51 billion streams, while overall sales of albums and track equivalents were down by 4.6% over a year ago, and are now at 210 million units. And, as a sign of what a strong role video is playing in the streaming game, the most popular track — by a very long shot — was Harlem Shake, the Baauer track that became the basis of a viral video free-for-all , with everyone and their mothers posting their own versions to YouTube to feed the meme. In the six months to June 30, Harlem Shake was streamed 438 million times, with the next-closest contender Thrift Shop from Macklemore and Ryan Lewis at 187 million streams. Those sub-billion numbers also point to how long-tail streaming is as a whole. Even as streaming takes more music and mindshare among consumers, the overall picture for digital continues to remain a counterpoint to big declines in CD sales. While CD sales were down by 14.2% to 78.2 million units, digital sales were up 6.3% to 60.8 million units. Nielsen SoundScan and Nielsen BDS, the two parts of the analyst group that compile the regular semi-annual report, note that this works out to digital albums now at 43% of all album sales — up on the 38% figure a year ago, but actually down compared to the figures released by Nielsen six months ago , when digital took a 56% share of all sales. Perhaps more directly impacted by the rise in streaming is the single-track digital download market — a sign of why companies like Apple, traditionally focused on downloads, are doing more in streaming services. Single-track downloads are down by 2.3% to 682 million (and remember: this is in a period when there were 51 billion streams). “Overall sales are down slightly in the first half of 2013, but there continues to be encouraging growth in digital album sales,” writes David Bakula, SVP Nielsen Entertainment. But it’s not all bleak for physical sales. Vinyl is still hanging in there and growing, albeit more as a niche/novelty business at this point. There were 2.9 million vinyl albums sold, up 33.5% on a year ago. Looking at some of Nielsen’s findings in more detail, there is some difference in popular tracks and albums between those who buy digital versus those who go for more traditional formats, but across the board, when it comes to where labels are positioned, the picture is more uniform, with Universal Music the biggest player in every category and split charted by Nielsen. Its market share is 35% and higher across digital and physical categories — a sign of some consolidation for the company, which a year ago was more competitive against Sony Music. Those who are most popular in streaming, meanwhile, cannot necessarily convert that into sales. Although Harlem Shake was the most popular streamed track because of all those viral videos, it failed to make it into the top-ten for single track sales. The more lucrative in terms of making a return was Macklemore, whose number-two-streamed track Thrift Shop was also the top-selling digital song, and the fifth most-played radio song (not really a driver of revenues, I think). It was also the number-three digital album and the number-seven physical album. Justin Timberlake was the top-selling artist in all album categories, physical and otherwise, while his Suit & Tie with Jay-Z was number-seven among digital tracks but didn’t crack the top-10 for streaming, despite all that MySpace prime positioning earlier on in the year .

"An Analysis Of A Pdf Exploit

Most people think of PDF documents as static pieces of information. How could a PDF file compromise your computer? The reality is that PDF documents can contain all sorts of stuff, and clever miscreants have figured out how to exploit that stuff to wreak havoc on your computer. PDF exploits are on the rise, and they’re especially nasty not just because most people don’t realize this is a viable attack vector, but because the symptoms simply look like a PDF file won’t open: click, Adobe Acrobat fires up, then randomly closes some seconds later. “Huh, bad file” is what most people will think, and move on with their lives, completely unaware that the computer is infected. Here’s a really good analysis of a malicious PDF . The PDF document structure has obfuscated Javascript code embedded in it. After a delay of 10 seconds, the Javascript makes a request to an Internet site to download an executable file, and *boom* your computer is compromised. Your anti-virus software may catch the roguefile, but it might not. The Internet: this is a dangerous place . I’ve seen exactly one malicious PDF file in the wild. It hit one of the students I support, and we got really lucky in catching the infection before it could spread to other hosts on our network: the malware payload was not recognized by our antivirus software, so we might never have known except that the student reported problems opening this PDF. It was a fascinating thing to diagnose, because it’s so far outside the realm of what we normally see. It’s a tired old refrain: update all of the software on your Windows computer. Everyone is tired of hearing it, because frankly it’s too much work. Too many applications update in different ways, and on different schedules: Windows Update, Mozilla’s built-in updater, Adobe’s Update Manager, Java, etc etc. The reality is, though, that it is quite important to do, despite the effort. Microsoft could likely make a lot of users very happy if they were to implement a solid unified update solution, like that used in OSX and most Linux distributions. One option, at least with respect to PDF files, may be to use something other than Adobe Acrobat. I don’t know if things like Foxit or CutePDF are similarly vulnerable. Can anyone weigh in on the comments about that?

"Google Launches Scraper Report To Report Scammy Sites, Gets Reported As Best Example

 If you publish quality web content, you’re going to get scraped. Unsavory characters who want content on which they can sell advertising spider your content, lift it, and publish it as their own.  That’s how I write on such esteemed sites as da6nci.com.  Yesterday, Google announced a tool to combat that, called the Scraper Report, which allows legitimate site owners to report sites that are stealing their content and publishing it as their own. SEO and Google expert Matt Cutts announced it via Twitter, and as ad expert Larry Kim of WordStream noticed , hilarity ensued.  Because, according to some, Google is the biggest and best scraper site on the planet.   Dan Barker, an e-commerce and digital marketing expert, pointed out via a simple screenshot that Google scrapes vast swathes of the Internet, especially Wikipedia. Kim retweeted it — the first to do so — and thousands followed. As of Friday morning, Barker’s original tweet has over 14,000 retweets and almost 12,000 favorites.  One joker, Mariano Amartino, had an interesting idea of what to do with the tweet:  @danbarker  @mattcutts LOL… I´ll make a tshirt of this and take it to the next “AdSense Partners Summit” :P  — Mariano Amartino (@amartino) February 27, 2014  The key point here, of course, is not just the immediate comic value of Barker’s response to Matt Cutts, who commands almost god-like reverence and fear among search engine optimization and online marketing aficionados. The key point is that Barker hit on precisely the pain point that online marketers are feeling vis-a-vis Google, which by far dominates the search landscape and therefore sits at the epicenter of every search marketer’s world.  With its constant algorithm updates that attempt to improve the web search experience for most of us, Google inevitably hurts some sites on a regular basis — such as JC Penney a number of years ago , which the search giant whacked for scammy-looking links. Rap Genius found itself on the wrong side of Google’s wrath for much the same reason just recently.  Most of the time, the results are probably better for most, but sometimes Google’s actions seem arbitrary, self-serving, and unfair .  In this case, Barker is perhaps suggesting that Google take some of its own medicine.

"Ecomotors Receives New Investment From Current Customer, Zhongding Power, Adding To The Funding From Bill Gates And Khosla Ventures

 ALLEN PARK, Mich.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 22, 2015– EcoMotors (EM) announced today that it has secured a lead investor for       their series D funding round-EM’s largest customer, Zhongding Power,  a       subsidiary of China-based Zhongding Group. The amount of the investment       is undisclosed.  The investment signals a tightening bond between the two companies, as       Zhongding Power signed a product development agreement in 2010 and       license agreement in 2013 to develop and produce EM’s opoc ® engine technology in China.  opoc ® is a breakthrough engine technology with the potential       to be the world’s most efficient, cost effective, lightweight internal       combustion engine. One of the largest automotive component conglomerates       in China, Zhongding will finance and construct the first opoc ® plant in the Anhui province.  Zhongding joins an elite group of investors, including Bill Gates,       Khosla Ventures and Braemar Energy Ventures, sharing the belief of the       global potential of opoc ® technology and the disruptive       effect it will have on the industry.  “Zhongding is EM’s first customer; it’s a pleasure to now have them as       one of our key investors as well” EM President and CEO Amit Soman said.       “They, like Bill Gates and Khosla, believe we can change how people       think about the combustion engine and create a technology that will be       revolutionary for the entire world.”  “Zhongding is proud to be a major driver of a technology that has the       potential to have a global impact on so many different industries and       products,” said Xia Dinghu, Chairman of Zhongding Group. “We believe       that this game-changing technology will help solve some of the       environmental challenges we face today by offering a more efficient and       lower cost engine.”  The existing agreement with EM represents an investment by Zhongding of       more than $200 million. The new plant will have a capacity to produce an       estimated 100,000 engines per year.  The opoc ® engine will deliver the same power levels as       conventional engines but in a smaller, lighter, more cost effective       package. When compared to a state-of-the-art, conventional turbo-diesel       engine, the opoc ® engine has the potential to deliver an       improvement of more than 15 percent in fuel economy.  Zhongding plans to supply opoc ® engines to a broad range of       customers and applications, including power generation sets, as well as       off-road and commercial vehicles.   About EcoMotors   Established in 2008, EcoMotors is changing the landscape of internal       combustion power. Based in Allen Park, Mich., EcoMotors is       commercializing the opoc ® engine for use in cars, light       trucks, commercial vehicles, marine, agriculture, auxiliary power units,       generators, etc. Anywhere conventional gas or diesel power is currently       utilized, opoc ® represents a better propulsion solution.   About Zhongding   The Zhongding Holding (Group) Co., Ltd. is a diversified international       company established in 1980 with headquarters located within the       economic and technical development zone of Ningguo, Anhui Province,       China.

"Tv Time Holds Steady Against The Internet

 In the past five years, Americans have dropped their time spent with radio and newspapers by nearly one-fifth, according to Forrester Research’s latest Internet use survey . In return, they’ve more than doubled their Internet usage, jumping from six hours per week average to more than 12.  But the 40,000 American adults surveyed by Forrester haven’t changed the amount of time they spend watching TV. U.S. consumers average 13 hours of TV per week, a figure that hasn’t changed since Forrester began collecting data in 2004. This is despite the fact that one quarter of online consumers now watch full-length TV shows on the Internet, and a third watch some sort of video content online. YouTube and Hulu users still manage to fit in another 13 hours of traditional television on average.  [Photo from blogcdn.com ]

"Nba Jams Into Esports: Warriors’ Guber, Wizards’ Leonsis, And Magic Johnson Buy Team Liquid

 Basketball? Baseball? How 20th century. Today’s sports mogul is looking toward digital competition.  Team Liquid has announced that it has sold the controlling interest of its esports organization to an ownership group led by Peter Guber and Ted Leonsis. Guber is the co-owner of the Golden State Warriors of the NBA, the Los Angeles Dodgers of MLB, and Los Angeles Football Club soccer team. Leonsis runs Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Washington Capitals NHL team, the Washington Wizards basketball team, the Washington Mystics women’s basketball team, and the Washington Valor arena football team. Now, they’re investing in an esports industry worth $493 million and growing. Intelligence firm Newzoo projects that esports will drive $1.1 billion in revenues by 2019, which makes the market ripe for investing.  Magic Johnson, the Hall of Fame basketball player and Lakers icon, is also a part of the investing co-ownership group. Guber also runs the Mandalay Entertainment Group, which releases movies to global markets. He previously worked for Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures. Leonsis is a co-founder and partner at Revolution Growth, a $1 billion set of investment funds. He was previously a senior executive at AOL.  This is also another example of groups, teams, and people associated with professional sports getting into the esports scene. Earlier this week, the Philadelphia 76ers became the first professional sports team in North America to own a competitive gaming team .  Team Liquid is one of the most recognizable names in esports. It operates teams for popular games like StarCraft 2, League of Legends, and Dota 2. The group has 50 players competing on 10 teams.  Steve Arhancet and Victor Goossens, who serve as co-chief executive officers of Team Liquid, will continue in those roles.  “In a way, our involvement in leading Liquid is even more assured now than when we were sole owners,” Goosens wrote on Team Liquid’s site . “There is no place I would rather be than working to bring Liquid to greater heights together with our amazing staff and players. I’ve now put almost half of my life into Team Liquid, and I’m ready to begin a new chapter in the ongoing story of our presence in esports. Today I want to leave you with a message of reassurance that everything will be the same but better.”

"Smartphones On The Rise: Rim, Apple Overtake Motorola In Global Cell Phone Market

 Smartphones by Blackberry-maker Research in Motion and Apple continue to gain global market share against all other cell phone types, according to a recent report by market research firm iSuppli . RIM and Apple claimed the fifth and sixth spots in first-quarter market share, while Motorola fell two spots to eighth. The news is particularly significant since both Apple and RIM sell smartphones exclusively.  RIM saw the most growth of all Top Ten cell phone companies — shipments rose by 364,000 units, or 3.6 percent compared to the previous quarter. Its success went against the slowdown seen by the the rest of the industry, and caused the company to jump to fifth place, up from eighth previously. Apple’s shipments rose 0.2 percent from its fourth quarter 2009 numbers — which may not seem like much, but it was enough to place the company in the No. 6 spot, up from ninth place.  All other Top Ten cell phone companies saw a decrease in shipments. Motorola reported a 29.2 percent decline with 8.5 million units, down from 12 million in the previous quarter.  RIM and Apple’s rise this past quarter shows the growing importance that smartphones have in the mobile industry. According to iSuppli senior analyst Tina Teng:  Smart phones represent the hottest segment of the cell phone  market, with unit shipment growth of 35.5 percent expected in 2010,  compared to 11.3 percent for the overall mobile handset business. Because of this, companies that are exclusively focused on this area,  like RIM and Apple, have managed to move up to near the top-tier of the  global cell phone business. This shows that the smart phone is reshaping  the competitive landscape of the wireless business.  The research firm also points to Motorola’s shift away from cheap cell phones, towards higher margin smartphones like the Google Android-based Droid. While the company may be showing a significant decline in units shipped, its focus on higher end smartphones may increase its profitability further. Motorola’s profit margin actually rose 19 percent this past quarter, compared to the same period a year ago.  It’s also worth considering just how close RIM is towards overtaking Sony Ericsson, which is currently ranked fourth in the global market. RIM was a mere 31 units away from Ericsson’s 10.5 million reported shipments this past quarter. The next iPhone release also has the potential to further erode Ericsson’s position, particularly since its Xperia X10 Android smartphone apparently still needs some work.

"Moseying Toward The Mainstream: Overstock.Com Now Largest Internet Retailer To Accept Bitcoin

 You can now use Bitcoin to buy all the discounted bedding, jewelry, and furniture your heart desires.  Overstock.com partnered with popular Bitcoin wallet Coinbase to start accepting payments with the alternative currency. This is the largest Bitcoin merchant integration to date, and an exciting moment for those eager to push the “crypto-currency” into the mainstream.  “For the first time ever, customers can purchase a wide selection of goods with Bitcoins — from electronics to home accessories — from a trusted, branded vendor,” Coinbase said on its blog. “We believe that Bitcoin is nearing a tipping point for broad consumer adoption.”  Bitcoin experienced a meteoric rise in 2013, increasing in value from $10 per Bitcoin to a peak of $1,200 in a matter of months. At the time of publishing, Bitcoin is trading at $916 on leading exchange Mt Gox.  The digital currency was released into the wild, so to speak, in 2008, but it remained on the fringes of society, beloved by techies and those who appreciated its anonymous, decentralized nature to enable their unsavory activities.  2013 is when Bitcoin made its way into mainstream consciousness. The currency is volatile and controversial — there are those who say it is the future of money, and others who call it evil. While many more people have now heard of Bitcoin, far fewer are buying it, and even fewer are using it in regular life.  “Most people are using it like an asset right now, investing in it like gold or Google” said Adam Draper, who runs a Bitcoin startup accelerator called Boost. “Bitcoin has so much potential, and that’s why the believers are trying to facilitate its use as a currency, so people use to buy things and spread it around more.”  This is why Overstock’s acceptance of Bitcoin is such a big deal.  Overstock has been around since 1999. It pulled in over $1 billion in revenue in 2012, and it sells nearly 100,000 mainstream, everyday products on its site. The partnership is not only a validation for Bitcoin but also a political statement from Overstock’s libertarian CEO, Patrick Byrne, who told Wired that “it helps us fight the machine” of big banks and big government.  The currency’s volatility is part of what deters retailers and Bitcoin owners from accepting and spending it. The fear is that if Bitcoin is valued at one price and then drops down, the merchant loses money. Or if the price goes up, the owner would have been better off keeping their Bitcoin.  Coinbase created a set of merchant tools to deal this concern . It guarantees a certain exchange rate, and immediately cashes out that Bitcoin value and transfers it in dollars to the retailer. Coinbase assumes the risk, rather than the retailer.  There are also tangible benefits beyond “pushing the movement forward” to accepting Bitcoin. The currency eliminates credit card processing fees, so it’s much cheaper for retailers than accepting payments from Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or PayPal.  Coinbase also powers Bitcoin payments for Reddit, Crowdtilt, Humble Bundle, OKCupid, and Khan Academy.

"Onlive To Launch Cloud Games In Uk In September

 OnLive is launching its cloud gaming service for the United Kingdom on Sept. 22. This is the the first major international expansion for the company.  With OnLive, consumers can play games instantly online from various platforms. Because the games reside on servers at internet-connected data centers, users can play high-end games on low-end computers. The games are computed at the data centers and then sent as video to the user’s computer, which displays rather than processes the games.  The company will launch the service at the opening of the 2011 Eurogamer Expo in London. It will have more than 100 top-tier games available on high-definition TVs, PCs, Macs, iPads and Android tablets. At the event, OnLive plans to hand out thousands of free OnLive game systems, which adapt the games to run on a TV.  The U.K. system has the same features that are available in the U.S., where OnLive has been available since June 2010. Users can see free instant demos of games, spectate multiplayer matches, create Brag Clips of their own exploits, and post those clips to Facebook. OnLive also offers a flat-rate PlayPack bundle with more than 70 games. Sign-ups for the UK are at this site .  OnLive is working on the launch with its major investor, British Telecommunications. More details about the collaboration will be announced later. OnLive players in the UK will be able to interact with OnLive’s North American customers. Rivals include GameStop, Valve’s Steam and other cloud gaming companies such as Otoy and Gaikai.  Besides BT, OnLive’s investors include HTC, Warner Bros., Autodesk, Maverick Capital, AT&T and The Belgacom Group. The company was founded by entrepreneur Steve Perlman nine years ago and has more than 200 employees.

"The Fez Soundtrack’S Hidden Images And How They Got There

  The soundtrack to developer Polytron’s Xbox Live Arcade-exclusive puzzle game Fez has only been out since Friday, but a group of industrious fans has already discovered a number of secret images hidden in individual music tracks and shared their findings in the game’s discussion board on GameFAQs . The stealthy pictures can be found by importing the compositions into audio editing software and poring through their spectrograms, particularly in sections containing mysterious hisses or odd silence.  Tumblr blog Black Coffee Spirit has posted several items from the soundtrack’s mysterious cargo. Some samples are below.    The track entitled “Beacon” contains a picture of the first footprint Neil Armstrong left on the Moon in 1969.    Greta Kempton’s 1949 portrait of President Harry S. Truman is hiding inside of “Flow.”    “Majesty” includes Salvador Dali’s painting Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus) (1954).    Lost fans should recognize the guy peeking out from the spectrogram of “Beyond.” It’s John Locke. Why is Terry O’Quinn stashed inside the soundtrack to Fez? I don’t know; why is anything?   The most cryptic of the images is a QR code that reveals a series of ten four-digit numbers (probably years). Internet detectives haven’t figured out what, if anything, any of this means, but the clue hunt is certainly giving fans a lot to talk about.  Portal 2 players might remember a similar Easter egg in which developer Valve broadcast a slow-scan television image  over certain in-game radios. Whoever put the secret goodies in the Fez soundtrack used software like AudioPaint to map out frequencies and amplitudes based on the positions of the pixels in the images and then spliced the resulting waveforms into the music tracks. If you’d like to see the process in action, check out the below video, courtesy of YouTube user gigafide :

"The Goproblem

Action cameras are like tablets. Lots of people want ONE. But very few need to constantly update to the latest model. I suspect this is why GoPro’s sales are slowing , it’s reduced sales forecasts , and it had to lay off 7% of its employees this week. It’s hitting market saturation. Many of the people likely to buy a GoPro already have one and don’t need another. Their first one is probably already gathering dust for 11 months a year. Face it. We’re not all extreme sports champions. We go skiing or surfing or biking occasionally. We want something to capture those experiences. Any GoPro will do. Our friends will be impressed and we’ll get to relive the memories even if the photos and videos aren’t shot at cutting edge resolution. Even if the battery ran low and we couldn’t choose from the entire day’s activity. Even if it was a little bulkier in our pocket. An action camera does what none of our other devices do. But upgrading to this year’s version doesn’t do much more. It’s not your phone, that you use all day every day and that every one sees. It’s not a status object. It’s not your laptop, where slightly better specs can make your life or work less annoying. It’s not a fundamental tool. An older, used GoPro or a cheap knockoff is fine. An action camera is like a tablet. It’s nice to sometimes read or watch movies or play games on at tablet. But my years old iPad is fine. When I bought it, I bought the newest one. But since then I’ve never even considered buying another. This, combined with growing phone screens has led to tablet sales to plateau , and I believe the same is happening with action cameras. Sure, there are adrenaline junkies and adventure photographers who will want the best action cam they can get. And GoPro’s own drones and virtual reality rigs could unlock new functionality that spur sales. But GoPro’s stock is down 15% today and around 77% over the past year. To thrive, the company will need to do something truly innovative. Otherwise there’s little reason for people to buy the newest GoPro. The one they already threw in a drawer is good enough.

"Price For Loyal Mobile App Users Higher Than Ever

 The price for acquiring loyal app users in the U.S. is currently higher than any time ever recorded before, according to mobile app marketer Fiksu . According to its data, the cost of a loyal user (defined as someone who opens an app three or more times a month) rose to $1.90, up from $1.80 in July . This means that app creators have to spend more marketing money than ever to expand their audiences.  Above: The Fiksu Cost per Loyal User Index for August 2013 Image Credit: Fiksu  Fiksu attributes the increase to a saturation of bigger brands in the market as well as usual planning during the holidays, a time when companies test different mobile marketing strategies.  “Mobile is where marketers are competing today, especially as big brands and Madison Avenue get on board in the quest to reach consumers where they are most: on mobile,” said Fiksu chief executive officer Micah Adler in an email sent to GamesBeat. “With marketing costs at a record high and only likely to grow as the holidays approach, now is the time for mobile marketers to hone their campaign strategies — before the real competition starts.”  The Fiksu App Store Competitive Index measures the average aggregate daily download volume of the top 200 free U.S. iPhone apps. Daily downloads were at 5.9 million in August, a small bump from July’s 5.8 million.

"Here’S A Big Career Change: Gears Of War 2 Writer Joins Zynga (Exclusive)

 Joshua Ortega , a writer who worked on the Gears of War series, has joined Zynga as a “senior narrative designer” working on massively multiplayer online games.  By itself, that isn’t a huge surprise. Lots of game developers are moving on from hardcore game companies to where the jobs are in social and mobile games. But it says a lot when the shift happens with someone who is working on some of the highest profile games in the console business.  Ortega is a former journalist, based in Seattle. Although we’re only finding out about his move to Zynga now, he apparently left Microsoft Game Studios and started working for Zynga back in April.  There was a day when game developers scoffed at Zynga games. They were so simple that they didn’t need writers. But Zynga has nearly 3,000 employees now and it has 150 seasoned game designers. Clearly, bigger things are in the works at the largest maker of social games on Facebook.  Ortega has written for every major American comic book company, including Marvel, DC Comics, Dark Horse, Image, Top Cow, TokyoPop, and Dynamite Entertainment. He has worked on properties such as Star Wars, Spider-Man, Star Trek, Frank Frazetta’s Death Dealer, and Battlestar Galactica. He wrote the novel Frequencies and worked on the smash hit Gears of War 2 and the Gears of War comic books. For Gears of War 2, he contributed to the overall story and wrote the entire screenplay.  Zynga declined comment, other than to confirm that Ortega was working for the company, and Ortega wasn’t available for an interview. He once said that he got into the game industry because of “my love for the medium and the art form. Video games, interactive entertainment, dynamic storytelling … whatever term we use to describe this medium, I’m just really excited that we’re finally being recognized as a legitimate art form.”

"Sony May Take Another Stab At A Smartwatch And Show It Off Next Week

Neither of Sony’s two previous smartwatches were runaway hits, but that doesn’t seem to have stopped the Japanese electronics giant from taking another crack at the concept. A slew of tweets hash-tagged #itstime started appearing on the official SonyXperia account the other day, and they hinted heavily that the company is preparing to show off yet another smartwatch at the Mobile Asia Expo in Shanghai next week. Sony seems content to keep all the juicy details under wraps for now, but it’s holding press conferences in Shanghai and Germany next Tuesday so all will be revealed in short order. Of course, if Sony really does bring another smartwatch to market, will it actually sell? Sony hasn’t exactly had the best luck pushing its Xperia smartphones (though the flagship Xperia Z seems to be doing pretty well), so pushing yet another smartphone-centric accessory into the field may prove problematic. To Sony’s credit, it looks like the company is even more cognizant of the developer community than before — as they should, since apps crafted for the wrist-worn gadget will really determine whether people take the plunge. Sony’s second smartwatch (called, unimaginatively, the SmartWatch) was eventually augmented by some 200 custom applications in the Google Play Store, and Sony recently sought to make the thing even more useful by letting developers cook up their own firmware for it. Still, I can’t help but wonder if Sony would’ve taken another chance on a smartwatch if it weren’t for some popular, buzzy startups. The meteoric rise of the Pebble and the wrist-worn gadgets that appeared in its wake signaled a resurgence and popularization of a concept that’s been kicking around with varying degrees of success for years. Subsequent (and persistent) rumors that Apple, Samsung, and even Google are eagerly eyeing up the smartwatch market may have only added fuel to Sony’s competitive fire. The company been churning these things out for the better part of 6 years now — hopefully this time they’ve got enough experience under their collective belts to really crack the formula.

"Wargaming’S Unified Premium Account Goes Live, Tying Together Multiple Online Games

 Wargaming , the maker of the wildly popular World of Tanks online game, has launched its unified premium account for all of its titles.  The new service provides pay-one benefits that span multiple titles such as World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. It spares players from paying for premium status in every project and gives players an increased experience and credit accrual rate in-game.  While it may sound a little dry, the unified premium account isn’t an easy piece of software to create. It is an important backbone for the company’s efforts to build a series of titles that can be cross-merchandised.  “From the start, we’ve been dedicated to offering our players not only triple-A gaming experiences but also unparalleled value and convenience,” said Andrei Yarantsau, the vice president of global operations at Wargaming. “The launch of the unified premium account is our commitment to those ideals, and we’re confident that players will find it a major element of their Wargaming experiences now and into the future.”  World of Tanks has more than 70 million registered users worldwide. The Cyprus-based company is also working on World of Warships. Wargaming’s chief executive, Victor Kisilyi, will give a fireside chat at our upcoming GamesBeat 2013 conference in Redwood City, Calif., on Oct. 29-30.

"Microsoft Targets Growing Mobile Workforce With 15% Hike In Corporate User Licensing Fees

Microsoft is targeting the growing mobile workforce with a 15 percent hike in license fees directed primarily at companies that have employees who use smartphones and other mobile devices in their work. According to Mary Jo Foley , the new licensing agreement goes into effect December 1 for customers with the user option for its “client access licenses” (CAL). The User CAL is meant for companies that have employees who use iPhones, iPads, tablets and other devices. As more people bring their own devices to work, the User CAL has become increasingly popular. The other option is a Device CAL, which allows multiple people to access one device such as a PC at a nurse’s station. Until now, the licensing costs have been the same for User and Device CALs. As of December 1, the following products will be affected by the licensing fee increase to the User CAL: According to the SoftCat blog , “customers that operate the User CAL model with multi-year contract-based Microsoft volume licence agreements (such as an Enterprise Agreement [EA], Enterprise Subscription, Open Value Subscription and Open Value Perpetual) will retain their pre-negotiated pricing until the end of their current contract term.” Under the new terms, pretty much any customer will face the increases when renewing or buying a new license. How to deal with this licensing change? There are a number of options, but IT provider Shi says in a blog post that there are three things to consider. IT needs to think about the number of devices on the network, how many to expect that will go on in the future and how simple to make it for employees to just get their work done. It’s clear that Microsoft sees a huge new revenue source with mobile devices entering the workforce. Other vendors are sure to follow suit with licensing. It all poses a vexing challenge and raises the question about what vendors to work with going forward. With licensing hikes like these, it will pay to shop around.

"  Stella’S Solar Car Wins The Crunchie For Best Technology Achievement

The best tech for 2014 is getting its just desserts at the 8th Annual Crunchies right now, and Best Technology Achievement is one of the categories that reflects true excellence in a field where it’s easy to identify standouts. This year’s winner is Stella , whose four-seat, solar-powered car won the World Solar Challenge and is designed to be a functional family vehicle instead of a tech demo or high-speed racer. Stella’s car uses a roof-mounted solar panel that can provide enough power to move the car 500 miles on a full charge of the battery, which is considerably more than the max mileage of a Tesla Model S. Stella is the product of a team-up between the Eindhoven University of Technology and NXP Semiconductors, and it actually manages to produce twice the energy it consumes through its photovoltaic energy system. Not only was Stella a showcase for clean energy, it was also a means to demonstrate new vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems that could eventually allow cars to work together to determine the best speeds to drive in order to keep traffic moving efficiently. Stella’s crowning achievement in 2014 was making the trek up Highway 1 between L.A. and San Francisco, producing zero emissions along the way. Runner-up this year was Apple Pay, a very different technological achievement but one that’s no less likely to become truly disruptive. Apple’s mobile payments play debuted this year with a software update released in October for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It quickly became one of the most-used electronic payment methods on the market, with new financial institutions and retail partners coming on board all the time.

"New Bill Challenges Mobile Early-Termination Fees

 Love rarely lasts forever. This is particularly true with cell phones. When a network gets overwhelmed and service slows down or a new phone comes out on another carrier, many customers will see the opportunity for a better life with that certain other provider.  The obstacle has always been the expense of divorce in the form of ETFs, or early termination fees. For many, the cost of canceling a contract is enough deterrent to stay in an unhealthy relationship — and the penalties seem to be getting worse. Thankfully, there may be some help on the way.  Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar introduced a bill to “rein in early termination fees” yesterday together with Senator Russ Feingold (WI), Senator Jim Webb (VA), and Senator Mark Begich (AK). The highlights of the bill include limiting the ETF for any provider to the amount of discount offered at signup. It would also require that in a two year contract, the ETF be prorated to 50 percent after one year and to zero after the second year.  This bill is contiguous with a series of actions by Kobluchar, who has battled for consumer rights with regards to mobile service before. Previously she has fought for the right of soldiers deployed to Iraq to leave the contracts without penalty and for anyone else who has moved to areas without service to do the same. Kobluchar’s web site makes mention of Verizon as a prime motivator for her latest bill.  Verizon Wireless recently upped its ETF for smart phone users from $150 to $350 dollars. When asked about the increase, Verizon stated that it was necessary to help offset the cost of discounting smart phones when a contract is signed. On a month to month basis, a Droid costs $559 dollars. With a two year contract and the guaranteed revenue of your cellular bill, Verizon is able to offer the Droid at $199 through its online store. In this case, the increased ETF makes sense — it is enough to offset the cost of the discount offered at purchase. Of course, the ETF is a flat rate. If a customer bought an HTC Ozone with a two year contract, it would cost them $50. With a no-contract MSRP of $350, the cancellation yields a $50 benefit to Verizon beyond offsetting the discount.  The FCC has written Verizon a letter inquiring about the matter and is expecting a response by December 17. The FCC wants to know how the ETF directly correlates to the cost of subsidizing smart phones. It also asked Verizon whether the ETF prorate plan was clear before purchase. Finally, the FCC wanted to know how it was that no other carriers had raised their ETFs if it was economically necessary to offset the cost of discounting smart phones.

"Netflix Planning Overseas Invasion, Slowly But Surely

 It’s been a long time coming. The video-on-demand provider Netflix has been talking about launching its service as a streaming-only version outside the U.S. for a while, but only now does it seem that the company is really getting ready to test its service globally, Engadget reports.  Netflix has put out job listings seeking people for its Hillsboro, Oreg. customer service call center. While based domestically, the positions will support Netflix customers outside of North America, and the applicants must be fluent in a foreign language in addition to English. The languages listed are Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazilian and European), and Spanish (Latin American and European).  One of the jobs, the position of a Training Supervisor , also explicitly calls for help in growing globally: “We are rapidly expanding internationally and are looking for a very bright Training Supervisor to help us educate our CS reps for that growth.”  Netflix hasn’t publicly said which country or region outside the U.S. will be the first international market for the company. Judging by the languages listed here, most of Europe is covered as well as important markets in Asia and Latin America. Also, the reach seems to cover countries with deep penetration of laptops, computers and games console networks, which Netflix could leverage for its streaming-only service.  Netflix did say back in January 2010 that as far as demand goes, Europe could be first: “The big market for Hollywood content (after the U.S.) is Europe…Third is Asia. Fourth is the rest of the world.” (Canada was “international-lite”, according to Chief Executive Reed Hastings.) In addition, Netflix was planning for a launch in the UK in 2004 but scrapped its plans to build its domestic business, which now boasts some 20 million subscribers in the U.S. After all this I wouldn’t be surprised to hear Netflix first going after a major European market, as it sets out for world domination.

"Crysis 2: The Crisis Is Where Do We Go From Here

After playing Total War: Shogun 2 , one of my concerns was how I would view subsequent Total War games. As far as I’m concerned, The Creative Assembly has now perfected the Total War formula, so to play another might result in feelings of, “Oh, this again. Hm.” The same fear now applies to the first-person shooter genre post- Crysis 2 , but not because the game is perfect (although it’s pretty decent). It’s just that we’re done here*. Someone needs to stand up and say, “Folks! We get it: you know how to create point-and-click shooty games with big explosions. Can we please move on?” Crysis 2 has a proud lineage. Crysis , released for the PC in 2007, still stands as one of the best-looking games ever created. (For better or worse, the first thing anyone is going to discuss when it comes to a Crytek game is how it looks.) The engine powering the game has since been made to do some pretty incredible things, from rendering scenes from the movie Blade Runner to making virtual trees look better than the real thing. The gameplay itself was solid but not spectacular: the first, say, two-thirds was engrossing—the jungle was a perfect setting, and the KPA was a perfect enemy—, but it fell off a cliff once the other appeared. Its predecessor, 2004’s FarCry , generated similar interest, maybe even more so since nothing at the time even came close to matching its visuals. That’s one of the problems with Crysis 2, that you can’t say it blows away everything else that’s available. You don’t have to look hard to find people who are convinced that the first game looks better the sequel. (There’s a 3D mode, and while I played it at an EA event several weeks ago and thought it looked quite spiffy indeed, I don’t have a 3D monitor as part of my regular gaming setup so I can’t really address it here. But if you can, you really ought to trying playing in 3D. Not that it’s the only 3D shooter available—I can think of Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Metro 2033 off the top of my head—but you get the idea that Crytek is particularly proud of its work here.) This time around you’re a man in a suit, sorta like last time around. Who you actually are in that suit is largely irrelevant since it’s the suit that does the talking, literally: tap the E key and you’ll hear it shout “stealth engaged” as you momentarily become invisible. Tap the Q key and your already sturdy armor becomes even sturdier (“maximum armor”). The game consists of you shooting your way up and down the island of Manhattan (anyone familiar with New York City will certainly appreciate running about Battery Park, Grand Central, and Times Square) fighting a mixture of human and alien baddies (which look a lot like Fulgore from Killer Instinct). I don’t want to spoil the specifics of the story, but let’s just say it’s standard-to-good sci-fi fare. I don’t remember if the first Crysis even had a story, so the fact that I can say that Crysis 2 does, in fact, have a reasonably OK (if typical—one part in particular had me going, “Really? Didn’t I see this same gimmick in Fallout: New Vegas a few months ago?”) sci-fi arc represents a tremendous improvement over the first game. Pretty decent soundtrack, too. I never found myself having to play my own music in the background just to have something to listen to. The graffiti looks OK here… It’s a solid shooter, but that’s part of the problem: the graphics don’t blow you away like Crysis or FarCry did (at least on the PC they don’t), so all you’re left with is the 900th shooter you’ve played in the past few years.  It’s not too long, but it’s not ludicrously short . It took me a little more than seven hours to finish, just shy of what I’d consider the perfect length for a shooter. (I’d say around 10 hours is the sweet spot.) Any longer and you’re like, “Alright already.” … this, on the other hand Our man in Europe, Ivan, played the Xbox 360 version, so here’s a quick word about that: I’ll also commend Crytek for giving you a number of different ways to play. You can play like you’d play any Call of Duty, shooting everything that moves until the credits roll. I, however, decided to stealth my way through much of the game. Outside of a few forced events, you can get reasonably close to beating the game without firing a single bullet. There are parts where firing and shooting about may be more exciting , but I liked the inherent tension of managing my energy meter, trying to find cover so I can re-charge my suit so I can then sneak past the bad guys without firing a shot in anger. Don’t mind me, good sirs More than a few things annoyed me—shock. As I mentioned the other day, textures are an uneven hodgepodge of perfectly acceptable to head-scratchingly bad. Some of the vending machines look like they’re straight out of 2001. The floating head companion convention is straight out of BioShock (and even that wasn’t the first to do it), and the lip syncing is fairly poor at points, like you’re watching an anime cheaply dubbed into English. Subtitles often don’t match spoken dialogue. People say the word “man” (as in, “Watch out, man!”) every five seconds. Why is there no car damage after you super-kick it? The PC version launched with a number of glitches, too, including one that made it all but impossible to play with a dual-GPU setup unless the main .exe file was renamed. Again, the unevenness is sorta jarring Then there’s the tactical options. Parts of the game let you know—more like bang it over your head—that there’s more than one way to get around a particular obstacle, with numbered icons representing actions you might take: grab a ledge up and over, shoot your way through with that turret over there, etc. But wouldn’t you rather discover these things on your own rather than have the game tell you “You can win by going that way!”? It’s particularly egregious in the beginning sections of the game when it refuses to return control to you unless you use your binoculars to inspect the numbered icons. Hand-holding gone too far. All in all, Crysis 2 is a fine game, but if you’re not a fan of the genre you there’s nothing here you haven’t seen before. I genuinely don’t know if I’ll have the patience or interest to play another for quite a while (unless I have to!), but that’s partially because Crysis 2 does enough things right to make me feel like the entire genre is approaching a wall. Die-hard PC gamers may feel let down by some of Crytek’s decision (Why can’t you change the graphical settings without using a fan-made application ? Why is there no Direct X 11 support ( yet )? Why is the default FOV clearly a leftover from the console version and patently unsuitable sitting-close-to-a-monitor consumption, and why can’t you change it in-game? Why is the multi-player mode so small? Why can’t I quick-save? And on & on…), but it’s pretty clear we’re a dying breed and our opinions increasingly mean absolutely nothing. You know things have gotten bad when I go out of my way to thank Crytek for not encrypting the .ini files~! *Until Half-Life 2: Episode 3 comes out, of course.

"Svelte Medical Systems Announces Completion Of 6-Month Follow-Up In The Direct Ii Drug-Eluting Stent Study

 NEW PROVIDENCE, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–May 29, 2014– Svelte® Medical Systems today announced completion of primary endpoint       6-month follow-up in DIRECT II (Direct Implantation of Rapamycin-Eluting       stents with bioresorbable drug Carrier Technology), a prospective,       randomized, multi-center clinical study comparing the safety and       efficacy of the Svelte drug-eluting coronary stent Integrated Delivery       System (IDS) to Medtronic’s Resolute Integrity™ drug-eluting stent.       DIRECT II builds upon the positive results of the DIRECT I first-in-man       study where the Svelte drug-eluting coronary stent IDS continues to       demonstrate durable outcomes with 0% clinically-driven MACE reported       through 2-years.  Providing the lowest crimped stent profile on the market, the Svelte IDS       facilitates use of the trans-radial approach and ‘slender’ stenting       while minimizing procedure time and cost. The IDS combines a thin-strut       cobalt chromium stent with a fully bioresorbable drug carrier made of       amino acids found naturally in the human body and the well-studied       compound sirolimus (rapamycin) mounted on an integrated-wire delivery       system. The system also incorporates proprietary Balloon Control Band       (BCB) technology providing uniform and controlled balloon growth, even       at high pressures, to safely perform direct stenting as well as       high-pressure post-dilatation.  “We are pleased to complete follow-up in DIRECT II and look forward to       sharing the study outcomes with the interventional community later this       year,” said Jack Darby, President and CEO of Svelte Medical Systems.       “Our drug-eluting IDS represents the first advance in coronary stent       delivery in more than 18-years, offering the ability to reduce access       site size and maximize procedural efficiencies while providing durable       long-term outcomes as good or better than the current market-leading       drug-eluting stents.”  The DIRECT II study enrolled 159 patients at 18 clinical sites in Europe       to assess the primary endpoints of Target Vessel Failure (TVF) and       in-stent Late Loss (LL). All patients were scheduled to receive 6-month       clinical and angiographic follow-up, with clinical follow-up continuing       through 5-years, with a subset of patients receiving optical coherence       tomography (OCT) imaging at 6-months. The study was undertaken in       support of CE Mark certification of the Svelte drug-eluting coronary       stent IDS.  Headquartered in New Providence, New Jersey, Svelte Medical Systems ( www.sveltemedical.com )       is a privately-held company engaged in the development of highly       deliverable balloon expandable stents.

"Glow, The Fertility App Founded By Max Levchin, Partners With Myfitnesspal To Add Bmi Data To Babymaking

Glow , the fertility tracking app co-founded by Max Levchin , is announcing today that it’s inked a partnership with MyFitnessPal , the popular diet and exercise tracking app. Starting today, users of Glow and MyFitnessPal will be able to connect their accounts. At first, Glow is only incorporating MyFitnessPal data about users’ body mass index (BMI), which is calculated from height and weight, Glow CEO Mike Huang said in a phone call from the company’s Shanghai office this week. But eventually, the goal of this partnership and others that could be established in the future is to incorporate as much relevant health data possible to give the full personalized picture of a woman’s fertility on a day-to-day basis through Glow’s ‘Genius’ feature . He said: Glow, which launched its app on iOS in August and plans to launch on Android in the future, has raised $6 million from investors including Founders Fund and Andreessen Horowitz. Huang declined to provide specific user growth numbers, but said “we are seeing very exciting adoption not only in the U.S., but also all across the world. And the number of people who have been telling us they got pregnant within a very short amount of time [since the app launched] is very exciting to us, too.” I sat down with Huang in Glow’s San Francisco office this past summer to see the app in person when it launched. You can watch that in the video below. I also talked a bit with Levchin about where the concept for Glow came from and why he decided to first target the fertility space. Watch that in the video embedded below.

"Web 2.0: Testing Out Bing’S Twitter-Juiced Search

 Bing’s Twitter search just went live this morning. Here’s a side-by-side comparison against some of the more prominent start-ups in the real-time space.  A few notes – Bing’s results seem about two to six minutes behind other search engines. Like Tweetmeme and OneRiot, they put a bit more emphasis on the content being shared rather than the tweets themselves.  1) Trending Topics — Most major Twitter search engines incorporate “trending topics,” showing the top ten new things people are talking about. Computationally, it usually involves comparing the word composition of tweets from the previous hour to the current hour and then pulling out what terms have changed or risen in volume. Bing shows trends in a tag cloud and makes Michael Jackson a trending topic. It also pulls out Magic Mouse, which was big news yesterday.    Here’s Brizzly for comparison, which shows trending topics in a list. What’s nice about the client is that its users can contribute explanations for why these topics are trending in a wiki-style format. CEO Jason Shellen says Brizzly users are usually pretty vigilant and fix incorrect explanations quickly (similar to how Wikipedia can be corrected rapidly after vandalism.)    Last but not least, here’s Twitter’s trending topics. They haven’t changed a ton since Twitter acquired Summize last year.   2) The results: Let’s do Bing on Bing — you get tweets (which are a few minutes behind Twitter’s search results) on top. Then Bing scrapes out the links, showing the content that’s been most widely shared on Twitter’s network. Another nice plus is in the content links, where Bing shows reactions and thoughts through tweets about the content. It might be more helpful if Bing had a two-column result page, with content in the center and a live stream of relevant tweets in a right-hand bar.   Here’s OneRiot for comparison. They put a lot more emphasis on the content, showing the actual link front and center. Then they show who originated the link and then you can click through to get reactions.   Here’s Tweetmeme. Again, they put a big emphasis on the content contained in a tweet. Their user interface also focuses more on how many times a particular link has been shared through Twitter.   Last but not least here’s Twitter. There’s no fuss or frills here. Twitter’s search team is still pretty small and the company’s tried to stay laser-focused on simply making sure the system doesn’t fall apart instead of adding new features. The results are just ordered by time published.

"Cisco, Itron Partner To Deliver “Definitive” Smart Grid Platform … Someday

 Networking giant Cisco and smart meter leader Itron have joined forces to deliver an IP-based communications platform to the smart grid market, but the announcement is light on details, such as when the companies will deliver on their promises.  The two companies want to create a “definitive” platform that defines a standard for smart grids, a catch-all term for energy-transmission networks which are more efficient, interconnected, and intelligent. The market for smart-grid infrastructure is projected to reach $200 billion by 2015 . That projected spending boom is held back by the fact that there are virtually no standards at present in this industry: Smart-grid communications vendors use a variety of networks, often proprietary, to collect and send data, making it difficult to guarantee robust security and interoperablility.  Having more interoperability between networks also could reduce costs for companies because vendors would then have to all plug into the same system, forcing them to compete more with each other.  Itron will license and embed Cisco IP technology in its meters and also distribute their software and equipment. But at least one analyst is scratching his head over what this announcement means. Bob Gohn of Pike Research said the companies essentially promised to deliver “a platform … someday.”  Though the “smart grids need standards” argument is something of an old canard, Gohn said the Cisco-Itron collaboration is still important: “A committment by arguably the top metering vendor to deliver a secure, open, interoperable program with a top networking vendor is kind of a big deal.”  “For Itron, this builds their IP street cred. For Cisco, it gives them a channel to proliferate some of their special sauce that goes into IP that goes into millions of meters that are being deployed out there,” Gohn added.  It’s also something that utility companies have been clamoring for.  “If they’re going to spend money and install the smart grid system and it’s going to communicate with their software and all the stuff they have on the backend, they want to make sure 20, 30 years down the line, their software systems can still talk to all these meters,” said Jacob Grose, senior analyst for Lux Research.   There’s no definite date on when the market would see this platform, though — in a press conference earlier today, representatives were tight-lipped on their timeline. And overall, Grose said the announcement isn’t significant since the two companies don’t have an exclusive agreement – Cisco will be able to shop the product around to other smart grid networking companies.

"Fastly Raises $10M For Content Delivery Network Built For Mobile, Real-Time World

Fastly has raised $10 million in a Series B round for its SSD-powered content delivery network (CDN) used by the likes of Disqus, Twitter and GitHub. The round was led by August Capital. Fastly, founded by Artur Bergman, the former CTO of Wikia , uses a patent-pending fast-caching engine that delivers content at what the company says is the fastest recorded time to first byte . Fastly caches content, making it possible to do instant purges. For example, on a blog like TechCrunch, a writer may post and then a few minutes later update the story. Until the cache purges, readers will see the older version. As we all know, purges that do not happen quickly can make for a horrid user experience. Legacy CDNs often have older infrastructure, Bergman said in a phone interview. Replacing servers with SSD is often costly and requires knowledge about how to program it. Fastly started from scratch with SSDs and has the experience to program the SSD correctly. Bergman said legacy providers might take seven to 10 minutes to update. With its SSD and 10 gigabyte network ports, Fastly can have a site updated in 120 milliseconds. They do this also by designing the network for small data objects, meaning real-time updates, such as photos or tweets. The pioneering CDN providers were designed to move large data objects, not real-time updates. They just can’t move data in the volume and velocity that is the norm in today’s world. Fastly is expanding its network with the new funding. They say they primarily see competitors such as Edgecast and Akamai when talking to customers.

"New Relic Files To Go Public

New Relic, a company that provides app-monitoring on a SaaS-basis, filed to go public today . The company intends to use the ticker symbol “NEWR” in the flotation, and its offering is underwritten by Moran Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and four other groups. The company’s financials appear to be strong, when compared to current market norms . In the first 6 months of 2014, the company had revenue of $47.974 million, up from a first-half 2013 tally of $26.146 million. That’s 83 percent growth over the last year. New Relic’s fiscal year ends on March 31. Perhaps more importantly, as the company’s revenue has grown, its net loss has barely budged. The company lost $19.395 million in the first half of 2014, up only mildly from the year-ago total of $18.569 million. Compared to other, quickly growing technology companies that have shown widening losses in keeping with their revenue growth, New Relic has demonstrated that it has a path to profitability. As CrunchBase notes , the company has a number of competitors, including AppDynamics, and AlertFox. Presumably, the company will update its S-1 before its IPO with its calendar third quarter data. The company has $92.37 million in cash and equivalents, putting its current runway on what appears to be solid footing. The IPO listing indicates that the company intends to raise up to $100 million in its offering, though I would not be surprised to see that number to revised upwards later. New Relic has raised $214.5 million to date , making the currently-listed $100 million for its IPO somewhat light, in a ratio sense. The company’s last round, which came earlier this year, totaled $100 million in its own right . All told, it seems that New Relic is in better shape than other companies looking to pull the trigger, and so, provided that we don’t see additional market chop, the offering should make it live.

"Mark Pincus On Zynga Stats, ""Dog Activated"", And Frontierville Same-Sex Marriages

Today at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, Zynga CEO Mark Pincus took the stage for about 10 minutes to talk about his fast-rising company. First he quickly rattled off some stats: Pincus also noted that one game, Frontierville, has 650,000 same-sex marriages. “That’s amazing, that’s probably more than any country in the whole world ,” he quipped. Pincus said that his company’s main goal is to convince you that it’s worth it to take a 10 minute break. We don’t have time for full TV shows anymore, but we have time for short, fun games, is his belief. So what’s next for the company? Pincus talked about something called “Dog Activated” — a more social experience across the entire Zynga network. The core idea is that if you see the Zynga dog (their logo), you know someone is playing a Zynga game. “ We have more than 3 million peak concurrent users ,” Pincus said. He also said that at any given point, 4 people you know are playing a Zynga game. Yes, they’re everywhere. Zynga wants to make it easier for all those people to connect both in games and out of games. Expect to hear a lot more about this in the coming months. Pincus also talked a little bit more about his “dial tone” idea . Facebook is the social dial tone, for example. They’re the underlying current for everything social on the web. Pincus wants Zynga to be the social gaming dial tone.

"Techstars Launches 11 New Startups In Boulder

Editor’s note : The following report comes from Don Dodge, who blogs at Don Dodge on The Next Big Thing and is a Developer Advocate for Google. TechStars is a seed accelerator program that selects about ten companies a year and provides funding of $18,000 per team, as well as support and mentorship. Dodge covered the last Boulder TechStars class in August, 2009 when six companies (including SendGrid and Next Big Sound) went on to secure venture investment of more than $10 million in total. TechStars has now been operating for four years. According to results data that TechStars has published , six of the first twenty companies to go through the program have been acquired by larger companies, and about 70% of its companies have been funded and/or are now profitable. This week, TechStars is debuting 11 new startups from the fourth Boulder class. The teams are presenting on Thursday to about 250 VCs and angel investors for the first time. These companies are about three months old and have two or three founder employees. Below are Don’s notes on the startups that presented. ADstruc is an auction and listing marketplace for outdoor billboard advertising. The company says that outdoor advertising purchases are currently managed offline. They provide an online inventory management service for sellers, as well as a marketplace for transactions. Today, it’s difficult for would-be buyers to identify and purchase outdoor advertising. ADstruc aims to bring the same level of access and transparency to the outdoor advertising market as Google does with Adwords for keyword search. StatsMix allows companies to easily build, visualize, and share custom management dashboards for displaying and analyzing key metrics from their own Websites and external APIs.  StatsMix already supports and integrates with metrics from about 30 popular web services, including  Google Analytics, Quantcast, MailChimp, Freshbooks, Twitter, Facebook, Get Satisfaction, WordPress, and YouTube, and is adding more regularly. They also provide a REST based API and other simple mechanisms to integrate with internal metrics.  The company showed off a unique “insight engine” which automatically draws correlations between various metrics, helping users to quickly identify what may be driving trends or anomalies. GearBox is a smart toy company that has created a robotic ball which is controlled via a smartphone. Applications can be built on the smartphone via a simple API which requires minimal coding. Early applications include “Sumo,” where two people attempt to knock each other off of a table, “Golf,” where you swipe the phone to shoot the ball at the hole, and “Kittens,” in which users can earn points by playing with their cat and causing certain interactions. Here’s a video of the ball that has already attracted 63,000+ views. The company has other smart toys already in development that will use a similar API. Vacation Rental Partner makes it easy to manage your vacation rental home. Targeted at individuals who have vacation rental homes that they manage who don’t want to pay 30-50% of their income to management companies, Vacation Rental Partner handles the entire process including managing booking requests, contracting, billing, as well as handling outside vendors such as housekeepers and pool cleaners. The system allows homeowners to manage their vacation rental calendar in one place, but allows for automatic distribution to popular advertising outlets such as VRBO, Craiglist, and many others. Omniar wants to make the real world clickable. They demonstrated impressive visual search technology that enables others to easily build applications using their toolkit. They are working with early adopters in the real estate, museum, and retail sectors, enabling them to allow one-click visual search and information retrieval. For example, Omniar is working with real estate companies to allow users to simply snap a photo of a home which then returns information about it. For museums, they demonstrated snapping a photo of a specific piece of art and then quickly retrieving details about it such as the artist and the story behind it. The interesting thing here is that Omniar allows anyone to enable their own applications with visual search capabilities, using their own corpus of data. Those customers can use Omniar’s technology to “scan” in the 3D models using the mobile phone as well, by simply recording a video from multiple angles. Omniar says that it is different from other visual search technologies by their unique ability to recognize fully 3D objects from any angle. Spot Influence finds top influencers for specific topics across the entire web including Twitter, blogs, and other types of content. The company provides a search engine and has made their technology available using APIs for partners who want to integrate it more fully. Rather than using a generic “influence score” and focusing just on Twitter, Spot Influence searches the entire web and returns results based on influence for specific topics. BlipSnips is a way to create social context around specific moments in time in a video. Long-form videos are hard to “sample” or quickly “scan” and as a result don’t attract the quick social web interactions that shorter clips do. BlipSnips allows users to easily share specific moments in a video across their social graph and increases engagement with those videos. BlipSnips has a set of free consumer tools, but also works with video publishers to drive engagement for commercial video. Kapost creates a marketplace for web content. It enables publishers to use the same crowd-sourced virtual newsroom approach popularized by The Huffington Post and others. Kapost works with existing content management systems such as WordPress and Drupal via plugins, and enables publishers to collect and manage content from a network of community members or external contributors. Kapost provides both the tools to manage the process as well as a marketplace for publishers and contributors and tracks reputation, manages rights, and handles payment transactions between parties. RentMonitor takes the headache out of being a landlord. Targeted at landlords who are managing 3 to 50 properties, the system handles rent collection, advertising, tenant screening, maintenance, and tax issues for landlords. If you have ever rented a property either as a landlord or as a tenant you will understand the need for automating the process. As a tenant, wouldn’t it be great to just fill out one set of documents, background checks, credit checks, and use it to apply to multiple landlords? The system is very affordable, ranging from just $5-$50 per month depending on the number of units being managed. ScriptPad transforms the iPad and iPhone into a digital prescription pad allowing doctors to write prescriptions faster and safer than their existing paper process. ScriptPad eliminates deadly prescription writing mistakes that contribute to over 7,000 deaths each year and sends the prescription directly to the patient’s pharmacy. The company integrates with all major pharmacies through existing partnerships. ScriptPad described a “magic” business model, in which even their free users generate revenue for the company because they are paid for each prescription that is transmitted. ScriptPad also offers a premium version that qualifies doctors for government incentives.  Here’s a fun Apple-style video showing how their e-prescribing application works. RoundPegg scientifically ensures that every hire you make is a fit for your company culture. According to RoundPegg, half of all hires fail due to poor fit with the company employees and culture. Most companies do a great job of hiring for skills, but they are flipping a coin when it comes to cultural fit.  Through simple self-service surveys, RoundPegg blends technology with psychology. It allows hiring managers to make sure candidates have a strong fit, provides interview questions to ask, answers to look for, and pros and cons that are specific to the match between the candidate and the company, the team, and the hiring manager.

"This Game Shouldn’T Be Left Uncharted (Uncharted: Drake’S Fortune Review)

  Are you a fan of virtual jungle expeditions, but don’t like leaving your cushy leather couch? Do you cosplay as the whip crackin’ Indiana Jones? Did you enjoy ogling Lara Croft’s enormous breasts in Tomb Raider ? If you said yes to at least two of the above, there’s a game out there that you have to play. This must-play title is not Indiana Jones for Wii or the latest Crash Bandicoot — it’s Naughty Dog’s Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune .  Uncharted puts you in the role of Nathan Drake — a descendant of a famous English explorer (or pirate) known as Sir Francis Drake. The journey begins on a small boat headed towards an island where the legendary treasure of El Dorado is reported to be held. Nathan is accompanied by a female reporter named Elena, whose goal is to get the scoop on this treasure and report back to her news outlet.   After only a moment of peace, the small boat is ambushed by pirates who are intent on taking the vessel down. Nathan and Elena make a narrow escape via airplane, and before you know it, they find themselves in a dense, yet colorful jungle.  El Dorado has been a frequently explored myth for centuries, so Uncharted’s premise isn’t particularly exciting, but what makes the story special are the game’s meticulously detailed environments, wonderful voice acting, and hyper realistic character animations.    Most of us have played a video game with visuals so detailed that they cause us to salivate before, but rarely do we encounter a title this colorful. Unlike games such as Gears of War that mostly focus on darker colors, Drake’s Fortune includes a color palette that seemingly makes use of the entire color wheel.   The variety of colors are used to great effect in Drake’s Fortune’s environments. Not only do players get to spelunk dark caves and ruins, they also have the opportunity to explore brightly colored jungles full of lush vegetation and roaring waterfalls.  Drake’s Fortune’s environments are brought to life through amazing lighting effects and shadowing, but it’s the subtle animations that truly make them believable. Unless a player stops to closely examine the scenery, they likely won’t even notice trees swaying in the breeze, and the rippling of water. Environmental objects such as waterfalls are so realistic that you’ll never find yourself questioning Drake’s world.   Uncharted’s natural and human made environments certainly give the game a lifelike feel, but equally important is the game’s solid voice acting. Naught Dog handpicked a talented cast that not only read their lines — they lived them. Okay, so Nathan Drake’s voice actor doesn’t really climb cliffs and score ten headshots per minute, but he donned a motion capture suit while performing his lines to give the game a more realistic feel. Each voice actor took part in this process, which made for a stunning result: the game’s characters were actually believable.  The voice actors’ genuine efforts weren’t the only thing that contributed to the level of realism found in Uncharted — the character animations were equally important. These realistic animations including actions such as Drake stumbling when he lands from a jump and the motion of his face made the adventure far more relatable to players. Sure, the stunts the characters performed were still fantastical, but the animations and voice acting made for a truly cinematic, yet interactive experience.   Of course nice visuals are all fine and good, but if the gameplay isn’t any fun, players might as well see a movie instead. Thankfully, Drake’s Fortune delivers thrilling gameplay that is mostly free of defects.  During the majority of the game, players will take part in two activities: exploring their surroundings and shooting up seemingly endless strings of goons. Okay, so neither of these pursuits sound very original, but it’s the level of detail put into each component and the seamless transitions between the two that makes Uncharted special.   Exploring Uncharted’s many areas is a joy, because you’re rarely spoon-fed what to do. It also helps that there’s always some obstacle to overcome. Players will find themselves climbing sheer cliffs, balancing while crossing logs, swinging on vines, and solving numerous environmental puzzles. There’s plenty of platforming as well, and there are enough unique puzzles to solve to keep players busy.  Uncharted’s dangerous environments are fun to explore, but equally exciting are the numerous shootouts that occur throughout the game. During these sequences, Nathan Drake  can fire pistols and automatics, lob grenades, and he can engage in hand-to-hand combat. All standard stuff really. What sets Drake’s Fortune apart however, is the unique cover mechanic.  In Uncharted, players can hide behind almost anything simply by pressing circle. They can quickly duck, hide behind a wall, move to another piece of cover, and they can quickly leap over small obstacles. Sure, this cover system is similar to what’s found in Gears of War, but it’s made better by the game’s intelligent enemies.   Your foes will work together to ambush you, they’ll hide behind cover, lob grenades your way, and they’ll pick you off with a sniper rifle from afar. Most of the time, these fights are frantic affairs that will keep players engaged.  Occasionally, players will also take part in vehicular sequences such as riding in a jeep (come on, every action game has to have one). Even though this is familiar action game fare, it’s a welcome change of pace from the regular game. Making enemy jeeps explode and riding jet skis up mini-waterfalls is quite enjoyable due to the fast-paced action and solid controls.   Uncharted has enough gameplay variety to keep most players satisfied, but it’s not without its faults. Unfortunately, there are a few frustrating encounters that are made worse by infrequent checkpoints. Sometimes, you’ll clear out a dozen enemies only to be ambushed by a dozen more with even better weapons. Getting nailed by a sniper shot, mauled by a monster, or blasted with a shotgun at point blank range after clearing out what seems like an entire battalion can quickly put a normally calm player into a rage. Fortunately, this type of scenario doesn’t occur often (at least on Normal), but when it does, it breaks up the flow of the game.  Minor gripes aside, Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune is one hell of a game. Its story isn’t all that original, but the combination of its colorful visuals, lifelike animation, and fantastic voice acting bring life to this cohesive, yet simple tale. These factors along with Uncharted’s solid gameplay and fabulous soundtrack make it a must-have PS3 title. If you’re a fan of Indiana Jones flicks or anything adventure related, go to the store now and plunk down $30.  Score: 9.0  Pros:   Features some of the most believable characters ever to grace a video game  Uncharted shows us how voice acting should be done  Realistic character animations make Drake feel like an ordinary human  Solid gunplay with a great cover system  Includes nearly photorealistic environments  The experience is enhanced by a sweeping musical score and great sound effects   Cons:   More checkpoints would be nice  Some firefights are overly long  The game could have used more weapon variety  The jet ski sequence wasn’t as thrilling as it could have been

"Hackrocket Sends Out Global Casting Call To Aspiring Mobile Entrepreneurs

  In the ever-unfolding drama of the technology world, the conflict dominating the stage is how to successfully create mobile apps. The question persists in front and behind of the curtain as entrepreneurs, investors, and executives act out their roles before a growing audience of smartphone users.  Multiple plotlines are at work. It makes for a complicated narrative of monetization schemes such as real-time bidding for advertising, premium business models, and apps with no revenue stream that run on a dedicated user base and hope. The growing importance of a strong mobile presence, combined with a shortage of talented mobile developers, further adds to this tension.  What a scene for HackRocket to enter.  HackRocket is an online iOS bootcamp featuring a cast of mobile development and business experts as instructors. It has officially opened its doors for applications and is ready to put the next generation of aspiring founders through its training program.  The 12-week program occurs completely online via live video feeds. It’s designed for students who already have a background in technology. The curriculum focuses on iOS development, with 10 hours of coding instruction a week at its core. In addition, it sports six hours a week of guest lectures that deal with topics relating to entrepreneurship.  “The course covers everything from A to Z,” founder Paul Vieira said. “We will offer help with design, app store optimization, copywriting, wire framing, budget creation, UI/UX, marketing, monetization, as well as language instruction. It is not just about building an app, it is about building a business.”  Classes are from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Central Standard Time, which makes it most convenient for people in Europe and the U.S. Interested people in Australia and Asia can also participate, if they are willing to stay up late. Applications will close on August 31. Tuition is $3,500. The first class consist of 26 people and classes begin on September 10. To apply, go to http://hackrocket.com/apply/ .  One of the featured instructors is Justin Beck, a young entrepreneur who has worked at both Google and Microsoft and currently runs his own gaming company, PerBlue . He has talked at conferences around the world. He covers how to translate coding skills into lucrative opportunities. According to Beck, many developers aspire to be found startups but do not have the right mindset.  “Technology is the underpinning of everything,” Beck said. “But to start a successful company, you have to have understand business, too. Being a good CEO is also about ‘softer’ things like public speaking, money management, organization, and social skills. It is about taking ownership and shifting your thought processes. These behaviors can fundamentally change the trajectory of a person’s life.”  The bootstrap mentality is a key component of HackRocket. Other programs, like Code Academy in Chicago and Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco, are location-based. HackRocket’s cources occur remotely and online. Without the structure of a classroom, students have to be highly motivated and self-directed to benefit from the curriculum.  The primary program instructor is veteran mobile developer Bear Cahill. Over the course of his career, Cahill has helped develop over 80 mobile apps and is familiar with just about every programming language out there. He has worked with major companies like IBM, Ericsson, and Travelocity as well as with small startups and individuals. The veteran developer is a firm believer in the importance of practical, as well as theoretical, experience.  “Many of the training courses out there are either video, so there is no live interaction, or condensed, so there is no time to go off and work on assignments,” Cahill said. “This is a new paradigm on the language learning model. My favorite part is hearing new ideas and seeing them develop overtime and come to life. With this type of course, we can all benefit from that.”  The students are expected to tune in daily to the lectures, but they must also draw on their own initiative to collaborate with their classmates during off hours. In addition to a lower cost and the convenience of being able to learn from anywhere, HackRocket also allows participants free time to work on independent projects.

"New Study Shows Cable Set-Top Boxes Are Electricity Vampires

 Think you’re running an energy-efficient household? You better turn off that cable box. Digital video recording (DVR) set-top boxes burn through more electricity than an energy-efficient refrigerator, according to a new study by the National Resource Defense Council .  The DVR set-top boxes can consume as much as 446 kilowatt-hours a year. The boxes are typically running because they are recording television shows while the owner is away from their home. There is at least one set-top box for every two television owners, according to the study.  An average home in the United States consumes around 10,896 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year . That means that the set-top box, which sits inconspicuously on top of most televisions without generating any noise, accounts for around 4 percent of an average U.S. resident’s electricity consumption. The device is usually running full steam, even though it is left unused around 66 percent of the time, according to the report.  That idle time costs consumers around $2 billion every year, according to the report.  More energy-efficient options are available, although not from U.S. manufacturers, according to the report. A U.K. manufacturer has created a set-top box that powers down into sleep mode — reducing its electricity consumption by half — when the device is not in use. The device powers up briefly every half hour to check if the owner has requested a new show to record through a smartphone, and then powers back down if it doesn’t have to record anything.  The report also suggests that manufacturers create more intelligent ways to program and use the set-top boxes — such as using smartphones to manage the devices instead of leaving them on all the time. It would tie set-top boxes into the “smart grid” — an electrical power grid that is managed by advanced computer algorithms to promote better energy efficiency and reduce electricity waste.  The report indicates that Energy Star, a government-backed program that encourages manufacturers to create energy-efficient appliances, should drop the hammer on cable companies that are distributing the set-top boxes. The next phase of the program, Energy Star 4.0, will have much stricter standards for energy efficiency.

"Panasonic'S Newest Electric Bike Features 97Km Assisted Travel Range

We’ve shown you countless electric bikes over the past months, but there’s one feature that makes the RX-10S [JP, PDF], Panasonic’s newest model, stand out: it boasts an assisted travel range of a a whopping 97km (60 miles) in “eco-mode” – on a single charge. Panasonic says that the bike’s motor (see picture below) gets juice every time you hit the brakes, for example when driving down a hill or decelerating (only half the amount if you use just one of the brakes on the left or right). Powered by a 26V-10Ah lithium ion battery, the bike boasts an assisted travel range of 56km in “automatic mode”, while the “power mode” will get you 48km (one charge takes 5.5 hours). Panasonic started selling the bike in Japan yesterday (price: $1,900) in white, black, and brown. No word yet on international sales plans.

"Bloomthat Now Delivers Flowers Nationwide

BloomThat has launched its flower delivery service nationwide, but it won’t be quite as on-demand as the services it currently offers in San Francisco and New York. Instead of offering delivery within a couple of hours, BloomThat will guarantee next-day delivery, which moves into the territory of 1-800-FLOWERS. “At that point, it’s a price point and a design piece, as well as a brand that our generation aligns with,” BloomThat co-founder Matthew Schwab told TechCrunch. To make nationwide delivery possible, BloomThat has teamed up with growers throughout the country to source raw materials and assemble bouquets stateside. At those partner locations, a handful of BloomThat employees will be there to ensure the quality and display. When companies go national, it’s usually because it wants to target customers in those areas, but not the explicit case in this scenario. BloomThat, Schwab says, is actually targeting its pre-existing customers in San Francisco — where the company is already profitable — and the New York Tri-State area who want to deliver to relatives in different parts of the country. Unlike many other on-demand companies, BloomThat relies on three key services for its deliveries: FedEx, UPS and Deliv. “A lot of the work that we did last year in setting up the vendor relationships is going to allow us to scale,” Schwab said. Before tapping FedEx, UPS and Deliv to handle the actual deliveries, BloomThat managed their own deliveries and owned the logistics from end to end. By changing the logistics around delivery and doing things like implementing delivery fees, BloomThat’s burn rate dropped from $560,000 to $15,000 a month last summer. BloomThat has raised $7.6 million to date, with the most recent round in April 2015.

"How Pillars Of Eternity’S Death Godlike Sees Through That Scab-Like Stuff Over Their Eyes

 The Godlike are captivating in Pillars of Eternity. These are children of normal people who are born with a spark of the divine, manifesting in many different ways. This goes beyond mere horns or flame auras.   Star Trek armor?  Pillars of Eternity’s armor system is a departure from the systems of other role-playing games.   The most mysterious are the Death Godlike. They have growths on their heads, obscuring their faces, and where most others see children born with these divine sparks as a blessing, a Death Godlike’s fate is quite different: Many are killed at birth. But in a recent conversation with game director and lead designer Josh Sawyer for Obsidian Entertainment, my biggest question about the Death Godlike in this upcoming PC role-playing game wasn’t where they fit into the world.  I wanted to know how they could see.  “That’s something that we don’t really define in the game. I think we described that maybe it’s actually translucent and it’s easier to see through from the other side,” said Sawyer in a recent Skype interview with GamesBeat. “There’s a lot of questions about godlike. How do they sleep? How do they do all these other things?”  Here’s where that look comes from.  Above: One thing these Death Godlike have in common? No eyes. Image Credit: Obsidian Entertainment  Death’s heads  Dmitri Berman is the character artist who came up with the Death Godlike. The mystery is part of the design.  “Because they are supposed to feel very strange and otherworldly, rather than try to answer all the questions about how they function, we just let Dmitri create very weird-looking things and we left those as strange mysteries of the universe,” Sawyer said. “The Godlike are supposed to be very weird and not fully understood in the world anyway.”  In most fantasy fiction, beings associated with death aren’t hale and hearty. They may be pale, diseased — you know, rather ghastly. But Pillars’ Death Godlike are just like you and me — well, other than the growths on their heads.  “It goes back to the idea that all godlike are born to ordinary people. They’re born to dwarves, elves, humans. They’re found among all races. It’s not really fully understood why they’re born that way. People assume that the gods are doing it, that the gods are blessing or cursing people. And so they look pretty much ordinary, except for their heads,” Sawyer said. “Because all godlike have very weird heads, it’s almost impossible for them to hide what they are. The rest of their bodies look more or less normal, although they often have strange skin or growths on their skin.  “Sometimes people react really negatively to that. Some people think it’s a blessing. But it makes it so that they can’t hide in a social situation.”  And it makes for one compelling look for a RPG character. I hope when Pillars releases March 26, I can make an entire party of these Death Godlike folk.

"Medical Carbon Research Recapitalizes With $32M, Renames Itself

 Medical Carbon Research Institute , a Austin, Tex., developer of mechanical heart valves, raised $32 million in debt, revenue interest and royalty conversion in a recapitalization that the company said eliminated most of its debt. MCRI also renamed itself after its leading product candidate, and will now be known as On-X Life Technologies.  Among those contributing to the recapitalization were Paul Capital Healthcare , PTV Sciences and several existing investors.  On-X makes and sells a pure-carbon heart-valve replacement called the On-X Prosthetic Heart Valve , which it claims offers greater toughness and flexible strength than silicon-alloyed carbon used in other heart-valve replacements. The On-X valves won European approval in 2000 and received a U.S. nod in 2002, the company told VentureWire (subscription required).  As a result, the company has been generating reveue for years, and would be cash-flow positive now but for the need to service an undisclosed amount of debt, CEO Clyde Baker told VentureWire. In addition to reducing debt, the cash infusion will allow the company to proceed with a clinical trial designed to show that patients with the On-X valve can reduce or eliminate anti-coagulent treatment required with other mechanical valve replacements.

"Subtitling Glasses Put The Text Where It Belongs

I prefer watching imported movies in their native language with subtitles. It would suck to give a passionate performance only to have some hack voice actor dubbed over your lines, don’t you think? Subtitles on the screen, though, are distracting. I like the idea behind the subtitle glasses. Using a Universal Soldier-esque optics, the subtitle feed from your TV or DVD player is projected onto the glass right in front of your eye, similar to how heads-up displays work. That way your eye can scan the whole big screen with the dialogue always where you need it. Clever. Right now, the prototypes are for theater-goers, but as the hard part is the headset, look for dumbed down consumer versions later this year, most likely in the $100 price range.

"Solar Storm Coming Tuesday: Should You Let Your Ipad Out Of The House?

 The sun burped. A big solar flare burst out of the sun on Sunday night, sending a ton of ionized matter towards the Earth at 1,400 miles per second. The resulting solar radiation storm from the ionized blast is expected to hit the earth Tuesday morning, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).  The consequences could be tough for electronics that don’t have the proper shielding. Solar storms can knock out satellites in orbit and force planes to alter their routes that go over the polar caps, where the planet’s geomagnetic shielding is thin, according to Scientific American . They can also create a light show, bringing the Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights, down to lower latitudes, perhaps as far south as Illinois and Oregon. It could cause blackouts, disrupt satellite-based navigation systems, and interrupt radio communications.  The last time this happened on this scale was 2005. The so-called Coronal Mass Ejection could hit the Earth around 6 am Pacific time on Tuesday Jan. 24, but the timing is not certain.

"Linkedin Api And New Homepage Drawing Near

LinkedIn , the social network for professionals, is trying to establish itself as a better destination with a stronger presence on the web. As a better destination, LinkedIn would experience higher levels of user engagement and more page views, which in turn would translate into greater advertising revenue. With a stronger presence, the site would grab mind share away from rising competitor Facebook , which has already become a household name for many. A new homepage, with a focus on providing users with reasons to return more often, is under development and meant to turn LinkedIn into a better destination. A “beta” version of this homepage will go live for a subset of LinkedIn users this Monday. The three homepage components meant to entice users back to the site include on-site messaging, news articles from around the web, and “network updates” (i.e. a news feed). On-site messaging is not new but will now enjoy prime real estate on the homepage, with the inbox sitting on the top of everything else. The news feed, which will be given third greatest prominence, will display the network activity of people in your network. Most notable is a new feature, discovered by Erick last week, that will display headlines from around the web which may be of professional interest to you. Unlike the early version of this system that Erick stumbled upon, the most recent iteration of LinkedIn’s news aggregator – the one featured on this beta homepage – will not require any manual training. It will rely on its own algorithms to automatically determine what you may be interested in reading, in part using the history of what other people in your network have read to make its selection (LinkedIn is not disclosing what service it actually uses to aggregate all the headlines in the first place). News articles will be filterable by topics such as: most read, company, competitors, and industry. More interesting to me is LinkedIn’s attempt to build a stronger presence on the web by providing an API, previously disclosed but until now without any real details available. There’s still not a lot of information, but the company has disclosed that it is actively working with select group of partners to develop applications with the new API. BusinessWeek, the only known partner, will implement a few features using LinkedIn’s API, as shown in the screenshot to the right. The API will basically allow BusinessWeek to draw from the information in users’ profiles and associate it with the content in its articles. One way to do this will be to display, via a popup, how many people in a company are directly connected to a user or in the extended network or geographical region of a user. LinkedIn hasn’t disclosed exactly when the API will be readily available but the company does say that the API will eventually be accessible to any and all developers sometime in the next year. The API will provide access to information in profiles, connections, search, network updates, and the “company insider” (its news article service).

"Pyod Lets Your Print Your Own D

Ahem. We begin this post by noting that the forthcoming material relates to human sexuality and should be construed as NSFW if you work at a retirement home for men or women of the cloth. The rest of y’all, hop on in! So PYOD is a product that aims to allow you to print your own dildo. The service wants to become your one stop shop for custom dildonics in that you can design the contour and shape of your penetration system and then order it. It arrives, 3D printed, a few days later. While many would ask “Why?” we are reminded that the heart is a lonely hunter and that we should truly be asking “Why not?” The project comes from Maroeska Wijsbeek of the Netherlands. “My background is in sales and marketing. I have a vast experience with toys, but missed the opportunity to design my own,” she said. “We are a Dutch start-up and living up to Amsterdam’s reputation by offering innovation in the sex toy industry. People are becoming increasingly aware of the many ways to have fun in the bedroom and this app is supplementing this. Thanks to new 3D Printing techniques, all that fun can be precisely shaped to your preference.” The hardware is easy to clean and hygienic. It is smooth and non-porous and it is produced entirely in the Netherlands. If you pledge you will get a custom dildo for about $36 and they are aiming to raise $100,000 to build out the service completely. While many of us might ask, rhetorically, “Aren’t all these things basically shaped alike?” I suspect we might be wrong. Because you can add your own flanges, ridges, mountains, and profiles of Henry Kissinger to your discreet Greedo blaster.

"Google Adds European Search De-Listing Requests To Its Transparency Report

Google has published some new details about the search index de-listing requests it’s receiving in Europe. The information is being put online in a new section of its Transparency Report where it also details link removal requests it fields from governments and courts, and also copyright requests — the latter forming the vast majority of Google link removal requests. The new section is called European privacy in search . Here Google is breaking out the number of URLs and removal requests it has received and processed per European country, along with the proportion of URLs that it has and has not removed. Overall, Google says it has received 146,357 requests for de-indexing across Europe, with 498,737 URLs evaluated so far. The proportion of requests granted overall is just under half (41.8%). In the U.K., the page reveals Google has so far received 18,486 requests for de-indexing covering a total of 63,616 URLs — and has granted just over a third (35.4%). While in France it has received some 29,140 requests covering a total of 89,277 URLs — granting 51.5% of these requests. In Germany 53% of requests have been granted thus far, with 25,206 total requests covering 88,973 URLs. The figures reflect cumulative requests Google has processed, dating back to the European Court of Justice ruling in May — which triggered the requirement for Google and other search engines to accept search de-listing requests in the region. That ruling deemed search engines data controllers and therefore required them to start accepting and processing requests from private individuals wanting to de-index links to outdated or irrelevant information about them. It requires the search engines to weigh up requests, to ensure privacy rights are balanced with any public interest in the information remaining associated with a search for an individual’s name. On the page, Google is also listing which domains are most impacted by the removal decisions it is making — currently Facebook.com tops this list; followed by directory profileengine.com; and then Google-owned youtube. This mix broadly tallies with recent data from search de-listing helper service, Forget.me, which also found that social networks and online directories were top targets for link removal requests. Google’s European search privacy page also provides a small smattering of sample requests (with generic details and specifics like names removed), to illustrate the types of requests it is granting and refusing. Samples of granted requests currently listed by Google include: Samples of requests it has refused so far include:

"Kantox Launches Beta For Peer To Peer Fx Hedge Transactions

Imagine you’re a company operating out of France, getting paid for a US-based contract in dollars. Your payment isn’t due in months. By the time you get paid, the exchange rate may well take a bite out of the money you’ll actually pocket. It’s a very common problem. Kantox , who launch their beta today, aims to fix through their peer to peer FX hedge transactions platform. Why not put together companies with similar needs on different sides of the equation? Essentially, Kantox is a long-term FX B2B marketplace, wherein two companies can connect via Kantox and through a digitally signed contract agree to exchange their currencies at a fixed rate established at the time of the contract. The transaction is delayed to a specific date, but the exchange rate is fixed, taking the risk out of rate fluctuations for long-term payments. It’s an innovative idea from two ex-Deloitte consultants, Philippe Gelis and Antonio Rami. The copmany has already been selected as a winner or runner up in numerous local Spanish startup competitions, including Seedrocket , OMEExpo Investor Day , among others. To date, between startup competition prizes, personal founder money and small seed investments, they’ve raised a total of 110.000 €.  Kantox – How it works from Kantox on Vimeo . The company aims for the SME segment, to replace hefty bank transactions, claiming that they can generate up to 60% in savings. Kantox charges companies an annual fee of 295 € (currently waived till the end of the year) and a .68% per transaction. So this would make most sense if you are a repeat customer. Apart from banks, Kantox is based on a model much like peer to peer currency exchange companies, such as Peertransfer , Transferwise and Midpoint . However, the key difference is that unlike the latter, Kantox allows for long-term hedge transactions at a fixed exchange rate, where as others don’t. To avoid security and fraud barriers, Kantox runs a number of checks and balances. Not all companies are accepted. They filter companies viability by evaluating their history, size, revenues, payment and credit history. This eliminates 80% of potential fraud they say.  Companies also receive two rating scores, the first coming from an external credit history provider and the second based on a client’s prior transactions within the platform. If a company breaks their side of the deal, not only are they dropped from the system, but Kantox refunds the other party both their funds and the commission for the transaction. More importantly however, the transactions are managed through a segregated account, meaning money is not exchanged directly between customers, but are first deposited into a a third account, managed by Kantox.

"Kinect Reveals The Next Job To Be Replaced By Computers: Sports Coaches

“It’s just as good as getting a personal instructor,” says basketball coach Julio Agosto, speaking on the Xbox Kinect’s new dribbling game, NBA Baller Beats . Agosto, an Emerald City Academy Basketball coach and father to b-ball Internet phenom, Jashaun Agosto , tells TechCrunch that Kinect’s digital eye is able to recognize and reward enough advanced dribbling skills that the new NBA game could replace human instruction at his basketball camp (at least the dribbling portion). This latest Microsoft development brings one more job closer to the chopping block of skills that can be done cheaper and more conveniently by a computer: sports and fitness coaches. Baller Beats plays a lot like Rock Band but with a basketball; gamers are rewarded for dribbling to a (rockin’) beat, with the familiar vertical scroll of colorful, raised buttons indicating when users should bounce the ball, and in what direction around the body. Evolving from its Rock Band inspiration, Baller Beats is the first title to recognize objects, allowing wanna-be athletes to hone their muscle memory with the very tools used in real-life gameplay. “Even a pro player can get a good workout,” gushes Agosto. Since this system is made for the home, players can practice to their heart’s content anytime they want. Interestingly, Agosto argues that much of his dribbling coaching is cookie-cutter. Among the most important tasks he performs is training burgeoning young b-ballers to keep their eyes on their opponent, simply by asking them to read how many fingers he’s holding up as they dribble. Baller Beats performs the same functional incidentally, since gamers are forced to watch the screen as they play. Advanced skills, such as dribbling through one’s legs, is equally monotonous, requiring a coach to passively monitor players as they perform hundreds of the same movement with pitch-perfect form. Observing an athlete’s form is essentially the same as spotting the correct outline of the human shape–the exact function that Kinect’s dummy digital eye uses to recognize movement. Agosto says the same is true for teaching proper shooting technique, for instance, by ensuring his students keep their elbows pointed downward. In other words, it’s not that Kinect is some Skynet-like genius, but that many of the tasks that “experts” routinely perform are no more sophisticated than the assembly-line construction that robots replaced decades ago. Back then, robots replaced jobs that used our limbs; now they’re replacing our eyes. The encroachment on sports and fitness training is just another notch on the wall for our robot competitors. Last year, the New York Times found armies of lawyers being replaced by computer software , which can just as easily dig through legal documents for keywords. In Florida, automatic learning software is replacing teachers , who have been reciting similar lectures for years. Computers may not be able to replace high-level thinking…yet. But, in the meantime, what other seemingly sophisticated jobs are we doing that could be next on the automated chopping block?

"Linkedin’S Mobile Update Telegraphs Its Interest In Endorsement Data

LinkedIn has updated its iPhone app with the ability to create endorsements for your connections right from your smartphone or tablet. The move demonstrates how important LinkedIn feels that this endorsement data is to its growing trove of signals. The app has also been updated to look more ‘iOS 7-ready’ and has a new on-boarding guide for users that haven’t used the mobile app before. The LinkedIn newsreader app Pulse for iPhone also gets a refresh which adds background downloading and a new look on iOs 7. But the biggest change is the emphasis on endorsements in the main LinkedIn app, and the additional connective tissue that this adds to its products on all platforms. In a blog post announcing the new ability today, LinkedIn positions endorsements as something that can and should be done on the fly. Previously, these kinds of personal recommendations have only been accessible from the web and were a fairly involved affair. You could draw a fairly clear connection between endorsements and the references you see on a resume. Thorough, in-depth explanations of why someone is good at what they do. Adding them to mobile, along with the language in the release, indicates that LinkedIn wants to ramp up the gathering of these endorsements. Faster, lighter notes about why someone should be considered an expert sounds like a good supplemental source of data that LinkedIn can use to index and recommend workers. Though endorsements have been around since late last year — and LinkedIn says that over 2B of them have been given to day — adding them to mobile introduces a new dynamic. In some ways this sounds like what Geeklist has been doing with developers and tech folks for a while. Geeklist allows users to create ‘brag cards’ of achievements and accomplishments that can be summed up in just a couple of sentences. If LinkedIn is able to turn endorsements into this kind of quick-fire card stack that can be flipped through by users and indexed by LinkedIn itself, it might have something interesting on its hands. Specifically, a source of endorsements that’s more human and parseable. LinkedIn has gained a reputation for being overly complex and dry. A layer of humanity and shareable ‘brag points’ could do something to offset that. These moves fit in with LinkedIn’s efforts to make online resumes feel more at home on mobile. Messaging services for networking and content are two clear facets of LinkedIn’s current product push, but this seems to dovetail nicely with the shifting perception of LinkedIn as a job search site, rather than a ‘connection’ resource.

"Google’S Next Big Glass Update Kills Video Calls — Adds Kitkat & Better Battery Life

 Google is dropping one of the most interesting features from Google Glass in its next update.  The company announced that it will nix video calls in an update coming later this week because the feature simply wasn’t good enough.  On the bright side, the update will also finally upgrade Glass’s software to Android KitKat, which should improve battery life and make the device more stable.  Google opened up Glass purchases to all consumers for today only — a sign that it either needs to clear out stock or that it still needs more people to figure out mainstream uses for Glass.  “We hold ourselves to high standards for the features that we build, and video calls aren’t living up to these standards,” the Glass team wrote on Google+ last night.  “Explorers have told us so directly, and fewer than 10 percent of them use video calls. For this reason, we’ve made the hard decision to remove video calls from Glass until the experience is better.”  The feature allowed you to make Google Hangouts video calls with any of your friends. I’ve tested Glass briefly, but I never had a chance to fully explore video calling, so I’m not sure what exactly led Google to drop the feature. It’s unclear when video calling will return, but Google says it’s seeing plenty of developers working on other video-streaming solutions for Glass.  Among other additions, the new Glass update also lets you send photo replies in Hangouts, groups photos together in bundles so they’re easier to navigate, and sorts your voice command prompts by how often you use them.

"Choremonster, An App To Get Kids To Do Their Share, Now Free. Parents Rejoice.

 Cincinnati startup ChoreMonster — the app that makes it easy for parents to assign chores and incentivizes their kids for actually doing them — reaches another milestone with their latest version 2.0 which launches today. This is a major overhaul of the service we first described to you back in 2013 . The new version is available via their website, via native iOS app and, interestingly, as a native desktop Windows 8 app. An Android version is coming in May. As a refresher, ChoreMonster is a scheduling and rewards redemption ecosystem for kids’ chores. Parents use the app to assign chores to kids; kids use the app to log that they actually did the chores and then be rewarded for completing them. Notable updates in version 2.0 include: The app must be working as the company has counted three million chores since Jan 2013. Additionally, the startup itself seems to be “growing up” too. Fueled by additional VC injections (they raised an additional 1.5 MM last August) the company is now staffed with 12 employees, up from the original four. Some might say it sounds like a crutch — that kids might not be understanding or appreciating why they are doing the assigned chores and are merely playing a game to get rewards. To that I say…um, yeah. So what? Building good habits can start many different ways and successfully maintaining them usually comes down to a system that helps maintain discipline. When the motivation to get habits instantiated is positive, it can really help maintain a habit. To me, this seems really similar to the scores of airline or other loyalty programs out there, that are wildly and behaviorally successful. I guess if you have to do chores anyway, you might as well have fun and “gamify” the process a bit. As a parent myself, I know I’ll try just about anything to get my kids to clean up after themselves. One question I asked ChoreMonster Director of Marketing Alex Bowman was regarding their monetization strategy. If the service is no longer subscription based, how are they generating revenue? The new version monetizes via branded sponsorship videos. Like a Crest sponsored “How to brush your teeth video”. The intention is to be a softer, less intrusive way to incorporate some advertising while still adding value to viewers in a lesson format. Ok. I buy that, I think. Also the new app design is as whimsical and charming as ever, and as I stare at my kids’ Pokemon cards strewn all over the floor of my house, I can see how there could be appeal to collect these monster characters. Bolster that with a mechanism for real-world merch and rewards, and it seems like a recipe for a cleaner house. I’m gonna give this a shot, and see if there is a direct correlation to my kids’ rooms being cleaner. I think there might be. Download info for specific versions available at ChoreMonster.com

"Homehero Locks Down $23M For Its Home Care Marketplace

HomeHero , a Santa Monica-based startup that works to connect home care workers with the families that need them, announced today that it has raised $23 million. The sum includes a $20 million Series A round of capital, in addition to a previously undisclosed $3 million capital event. The funding was led by Graham Holdings . I met the HomeHero founders, Kyle Hill and Mike Townsend, after their last startup, FlowTab, wound up its operations . Over the course of several interviews with them, I chronicled their progress with FlowTab and ultimate decision to shutter the startup. Things are going a bit differently this time. The company claims to have helped deliver a million hours of home care since January of 2014, have doubled the number of shifts that it helps facilitate since March of this year, and racked up 25 percent monthly growth so far in 2015. Not bad. As it turns out, home care is cheaper than I might have expected, averaging around $18 per hour on the HomeHero platform. The company nets around 15 percent of that figure, on average. (The simple math is $18 * 1,000,000 * 0.15, or $2,700,000 in revenue to date for HomeHero, an estimate that could be off by a huge margin in either direction.) Shifting from a $3 million infusion to a $20 million check demands new scale, and the startup seems ready to meet that requirement, planning expansions to two new California markets, including San Francisco. In an email to TechCrunch, co-founder Townsend indicated that the company intends to expand next to the ‘Sun Belt’ areas. HomeHero is a product of Science, a Los Angeles-based incubator. For a deeper look into the origins of HomeHero, TechCrunch has you covered . Marketplaces are hot, as are businesses that help connect two separate parties while taking a cut along the way. Some call this the “Uber for X” model, while others with a touch more historical perspective view the groups as middle people in the most lucrative sense of the world — that joke is predicated on solid unit economics, of course. HomeHero’s new challenge is to demonstrate that what has worked on its home turf can work elsewhere at similar margins.

"Feex Raises $6.5M Series B To Identify Hidden Fees In Users’ Retirement Accounts

FeeX , a service that helps users find and avoid hidden fees in their retirement accounts, announced today that it has raised $6.5 million in Series B funding. The round was led by Horizons Ventures, with participation by returning investor Blumberg Capital. This brings FeeX’s total funding so far to $9.6 million. Founded in August 2012 by Yoav Zurel, David Weisz, and Uri Levine (the founder of navigation app Waze, which was acquired by Google for $966 million last year), FeeX uses algorithms to identify and reduce hidden advisory, investment, and expense ratio fees in investment and retirement accounts, including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457, and brokerage accounts. The startup claims that fees can claim a third or more of the funds in a retirement savings plan and that the average American household ends up paying $155,000 in hidden 401(k) fees over the lifetime of the account. FeeX says that it currently has more than 60,000 users, who have more than $1 billion in assets, and has found $277 million in hidden fees. It launched in the U.S. in March 2014. In a statement, Horizons Ventures director Jason Wong said “FeeX has developed an objective solution that is disrupting the asymmetry of information that prevents ordinary consumers from easily understanding the true costs of their investments.” Illustration: Bryce Durbin

"Storm Ventures Locks Down $180M For Its New Fund

 Storm Ventures has joined nearly every other startup capital entity in raising a new, larger fund. Storm’s fifth fund is a $180 million vehicle that the firm has stapled a new venture partner to. As a group, Storm is known for its work with SaaS-focused companies. Its own Jason Lemkin, the other guest in the above segment, is something of a Bay Area uncle for SaaS, in that he has a habit of dishing tidbits about selling software on a subscription basis on Quora and other social services. Storm joins NEA , IVP , Freestyle and others in locking down an expanded fresh fund. The impact of these sequentially larger funds isn’t hard to understand: The capital flowing into startups likely won’t slow. What sort of companies, and what stage of companies the money applies to is a separate question.

"Video Blips: Mass Effect 3, Alan Wake’S American Nightmare, And Lollipop Chainsaw

 Like many of you, I'm replaying Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 in anticipation of BioWare's upcoming epic threequel. Well, ""replaying"" in this case means halfheartedly blowing up the same space pirates and mining the same hunks of rock I've seen hundreds of times before.   Video Blips:   • The female version of Mass Effect 3 protagonist Commander Shepard is just as capable at triggering multiple explosions and shooting colorful pieces of metal. Next thing you know, she'll be saving the galaxy from an ancient and evil threat using nothing but her icy cold stare.   Continue after the break for the grindhouse grittiness of Alan Wake's American Nightmare and the inseparable power of high-school love in Lollipop Chainsaw .       • Writers don't often get many chances to spark their creativity by blasting apart blobs of darkness with light surges, but Alan Wake's American Nightmare fits right up the pitch black alley. Don't miss the demon-possessed rear office going gorilla at the 2:14 mark.     • Commitment factors heavily into a loving relationship, and Lollipop Chainsaw shows that lopping off your boyfriend's head is a peerless sign of the strongest bond. I've heard of alternative keychains, but this is a little overboard.

"Hands-On: Apple News In Ios 9 Looks Sexy On An Ipad

 Apple announced at WWDC in early June the addition of a News app to iOS. The new app is coming soon to all Apple mobile devices running the iOS 9 operating system.  We took an early spin through the News app using a developer preview of the new OS.  On the home screen in iOS 9 the News app is pre-installed. You can move the icon to another screen, but you can’t delete it. Another thing: the News icon doesn’t look like it got much attention from Apple’s fussy but tasteful designers. Graphically it’s too busy and the colors seem stale.  Which brings up an important point. The following screens contain the features and design that will likely show up in the public release of iOS 9, but it’s not set in stone yet — some elements could still change or move around.   Here are the screens you’ll see when you first click the News app icon.       During the (short) setup process, the app asks you if you’d like to receive certain types of news stories in your email inbox.   The News app is broken up into five major sections, including For You, Favorites, Explore, Search, and Saved.  For You is a curated news feed built for you by Apple based on your news preferences. During the setup process the app asks you to choose at least three publications or news types.   New types include things like Music, Sports, or Finance. The list of pubs and topics seems to be endless; it continues to load more as you scroll to the bottom of the page.  I chose a few publications, like NPR, Wired, Time, and the Daily Mail. I also chose a few news categories (Music, Politicians, and Culture). Here is the For You news page the app generated for me based on my picks.     When you click on an article it displays in a way that takes full advantage of the iPad’s large screen space.   The artwork in most of the stories is very large at the top of the page. The images can be enlarged by swiping downwards from the bottom of the photo. You can also swipe downward to see the full text of the article. The stories usually contain a link to view the story at the publisher’s website.     Here’s the layout of a new story from the Wired feed.      The choices you made during setup live under the Favorites tab, and you can update your picks any time. While you’re reading an article, you’re given an opportunity to add the publication to Favorites.     The Explore section contains a series of news “channels” and “topics” the app’s curation engine thinks you might like. Channels mean specific publications (that you didn’t pick during setup), while Topics means subject areas like Science and Entertainment.  And under the Browse heading you’ll see more general categories. The nice thing about these is that they drill down into smaller sub-categories. For instance, under Politics, you’ll find subcategories like “tax reform” and “international relations.”   Under the Search tab you can search for any kind of news you can think of. You can also use popular search terms provided by the app.   You can save any news story you see for later reading. Quick links to the stories you save are stored under the Saved tab. You can also toggle on the switch at the top of the page to see a history of the stories you’ve already read.     By clicking on a settings icon at the top right of the article pages you can access a panel with all the normal sharing options, including Facebook, Twitter, AirDrop, and email.   All in all, the News app delivered reasonably relevant article and publication picks to me, although I would have to work with it for a while to further dial in my interests. The organization of the app seems logical to me, for the most part. The Explore section isn’t something I’d normally use, but the large number of subcategories might tempt me to drill down for specific news topics.

"Disillusionment Of An Entrepreneur

Editor’s note: This guest post was written by Prerna Gupta, who is CEO of Khush (now part of Smule ), whose music apps,like Songify and LaDiDa , have been used to create over 200 million songs worldwide. You can follow her @prernagupta . When I became an entrepreneur at the age of twenty-three, I began in earnest, as do all entrepreneurs, chasing a dream. My dream was clear. I would build a consumer technology company that reached ten million people and sell the company for millions of dollars, before the age of thirty. Then, as the dream went, I would retire to an oceanfront house on a warm Pacific beach and learn how to surf. I recently had the fortune of celebrating a year in which I saw that lofty goal fulfilled. My company’s iPhone apps had over ten million downloads, and a competitor paid a large sum of money to acquire what we had built, just a week before my thirtieth birthday. Dream had become reality. I took a trip soon after to a secluded surf beach on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. Sandy-bottom beach break. White sand. House so close to water that the sound of crashing waves made it hard to sleep. This was it. I had made it. Yet, as I sat dangling my feet off a seven-foot surfboard, missing wave after perfect wave, I saw an unmistakable truth. I was terrible at surfing, and all I really cared about anymore was launching another hit app. Far from retiring, I found myself more in the thrall of ambition than ever before. Having risked my career in order to escape, at all costs, the Great American Rat Race, this was disconcerting to me. My entrepreneurial intentions had, after all, been pure at the outset. I was drawn to entrepreneurship by the lure of freedom: control of my time, the ability to work on my own creations, no boss, and, of course, the potential for independent wealth. But the purpose of the money was never to buy fancy cars and houses, or to be richer than my peers. I viewed the money simply as a lifelong guarantee of these freedoms. When I had enough wealth to live modestly for the rest of my life without working another day, I would quit. I would stop chasing the dream. And yet here I am, still slaving away. How could this be? I am not one of those miserable over-achieving types who are satisfied with nothing less than better-than-everyone-else. Really. I’m not. Am I? You see, a funny thing seems to have happened just before I reached the ten million users mark. That goal of mine nefariously shifted by just a bit, a decimal point to be precise. I have a new goal now. It’s 100 million. This is the disillusionment of the entrepreneur. There is no such thing as success. It is a moving target. A mirage. By the time you attain what you thought was your wildest dream, reality has moved on and left your dreams in the dust. And the desire for success grows stronger still. I do not like being enslaved, by anything. There are times when I can feel ambition, that greatest of American virtues, imposing its power over me. There are times when I succumb, for a short while. But to allow myself to be driven by ambition alone would be the ultimate failure. I strive for happiness. Not happiness when I am sixty, but happiness now, and tomorrow, and the day after. And although ambition and happiness can coexist, I have found that the first much more readily thrives without the other.  I understand this now, as I understood it at twenty-three, and my values are unchanged. What can then explain the control ambition has over me today? Many who run in entrepreneurial circles would say that my dream was insufficient in the first place. Indeed, Silicon Valley frowns upon such middling goals as selling one’s company for mere millions. We should aim for billions, we are told, or not aim at all. I am loath to admit that I have let that over-achiever’s ethos influence my own thinking, but I suppose it is at least partially true. That’s not the only reason though. While my values have not changed, what has changed is this: work is more fun than it used to be when I was twenty-three. Work actually makes me happy. I always enjoyed entrepreneurship, even though I had many setbacks and failures along the way, but it is infinitely more fun now that I have had some tangible success. This is the real reason I continue. Success builds upon itself, and in so doing, makes the journey more fun. That is not to say I won’t still have failures, in abundance; I am certain I will. Yet underlying the day-to-day failures is the knowledge that I can never truly fail again, because if success does not exist, neither does failure. I am finally free. I am free of the fear of failure. Perhaps that was my dream all along. I’ll still learn how to surf one day, as soon as I reach that 100 million.

"  Twitch Ceo Emmett Shear And Coo Kevin Lin To Speak At Disrupt Sf

Twitch is coming to Disrupt SF in early September. The event, like everything Twitch does, will, of course, be streamed live. Twitch is a media monster. It’s at the forefront of the exploding eSports industry, as well as representing the entire video game ecosystem, including publishers, developers, media outlets and casual user generated gaming content. Just three years old, the video streaming service is changing the way gamers interact while providing multibillion avenues for advertisers. Google is reportedly looking into buying the company for north of a billion dollars. We’re excited to have Twitch co-founder and CEO Emmett Shear and COO Kevin Lin join us on stage at Disrupt SF where we may or may not spend the time collectively playing through all of the Pok é mon games live . Twitch was born out of Justin.TV in 2011. Since its founding, Twitch has stuck to its mission of providing a unique experience for gamers. Using a gaming system or computer, users can broadcast or watch gameplay sessions. It’s become immensely popular. Stats about Twitch are mind boggling: The company brags that 50 million people use the service monthly, consuming more than 13 billion minutes of video. The company doubled its audience in 2013. League of Legends is the biggest draw with 27 million daily players as of January . During peak times, the Wall Street Journal stated that Twitch can be the fourth-largest consumer of Internet traffic, trailing behind just Netflix, Google and Apple. In short, gamers love watching other gamers play. Twitch’s Shear and Lin join other notable founders and entrepreneurs speaking at Disrupt including Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, Product Hunt’s Ryan Hoover and Tinder’s Sean Rad. Disrupt SF tickets are still available at an early bird discount. The event takes place in at San Francisco’s Pier 48 September 8 – 10.

"Whisper Ceo Michael Heyward Defends Gwyneth Paltrow Post

 It’s not easy being interviewed by Michael Arrington. Over the last several years, we’ve seen our share of VCs, entrepreneurs, and big tech execs wilt under the pressure. But not Michael Heyward. The Whisper CEO held his own against Arrington, spending the majority of his interview at Disrupt NY 2014 defending his app as a place where authenticity and empathy reigns, where people can share private information and receive support from others who are in a similar place. That’s in contrast to the general trend of other social networks that tied everything someone did to their full identity, a situation that Heyward says results in users seeing a “highlight reel” of the best moments of their friends’ lives. And that makes them feel kind of crappy. In fact, he believes it’s created a lack of empathy in the world. Citing a study, he said college kids today are about 40 percent less empathetic than they were a generation ago. “Whisper is not about concealing identity,” Heyward said. “It’s about creating a place where we’re not carrying around this 800-pound gorilla that we call our identity.” All of which is something that Arrington generally seemed to agree with. That is, except for the part where Whisper is used to share information about public figures like Gwyneth Paltrow. Whisper made headlines recently when Paltrow’s affair with her lawyer was unearthed on the app. The question for Arrington was why someone should be allowed to share that information on Whisper, when the company works so hard to protect its regular users. “When you’re a public figure and in the when you are in the public domain, you’re in the business of promoting yourself,” Heyward said. “Gwyneth Paltrow is a public figure… When people have information about public figures or in the public domain… this is something of global relevancy.” It’s not an argument that Arrington agreed with, but it was at least entertaining to watch. Check out the video yourself above. Oh yeah… Sequoia’s Roelof Botha was there, too .

"Mobile Marketplace Carousell Raises $6M Series A Led By Sequoia Capital

Carousell , a mobile app marketplace that lets sellers upload items with a few taps on their smartphones, has raised $6 million in Series A funding led by Sequoia Capital. The Singaporean startup’s existing investors, Rakuten Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures, 500 Startups, and serial entrepreneur Darius Cheung, also returned for this round, which brings Carousell’s total raised so far to $6.8 million. TechCrunch profiled the company last year, when it raised a seed round led by Rakuten Ventures . The company plans to hire more growth and web engineers to support its expansion into Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Eventually, Carousell’s founders hope to take it further into the Asia-Pacific region. “In Taiwan, users are already used to buying peer-to-peer on existing desktop platforms, but there is still a gap in mobile. We took a trip there recently and realized we need to make a move immediately. Malaysia is similar and it is just across the border from us,” says co-founder and CEO Siu Rui Quek. “We made the decision with a few markets, but we also have global ambitions. I would say that in the larger APAC region, markets that could be interesting are Australia, New Zealand, and even Hong Kong.” Carousell has held the number one shopping app spot in Singapore’s iOS App Store since June. It launched in 2012 and founder Siu Rui Quek says that over 8 million listings have been created. Two million transactions have been successfully completed, and the app now sees an average of eight transactions closing every minute. Of course, the rapid growth of any new peer-to-peer network comes with some downsides. Carousell already has its own active parody Tumblr called “Carouhell,” which chronicles the misadventures of users as they deal with flaky (or just plain nutty) sellers and buyers. Quek says he finds the Tumblr funny (“I don’t know whether to laugh or cry”), but adds that Carousell will be adding several moderation tools as it scales up. As the startup’s team grows, they will be able to delete fraudulent users and trolls more quickly, and improve its feedback system. As Carousell expands, it will also have to deal with continuing competition from online classified sites, marketplaces, and forums, as well as Facebook Groups and Instagram, where many people make informal transactions. The team says they will test out new strategies in different markets, including desktop-first platforms, and try to win over users with Carousell’s ease of use. To use the app, sellers take pictures of their item, clean them up with Carousell’s photo-editing features, write a few details, and then list them for sale. They communicate with potential buyers through the app’s private messaging system. Carousell is still exploring monetization strategies, but potential sources of revenue include premium features for sellers, including extra photos and management features for vendors who list hundreds of orders. Though most sellers are individuals who want to get rid of used or unwanted items, small businesses and brick-and-mortar stores have also begun using Carousell, says Quek, giving the startup a chance to tap into the SMB market. In a statement, Shailendra Singh, managing director of Sequoia Capital India Advisors, said “Carousell is one of the most exciting young companies we have encountered recently. The company has grown with practically no marketing to become a leading destination for consumers to buy and sell goods across all categories. Tens of thousands of of products are listed and sold on Carousell everyday by consumers.”

"Verizon To Roll Out Tiered Data In Time For The Holidays

Data aficionados (perhaps deservedly) worked their panties into a bunch when AT&T removed unlimited data as an option for their myriad smartphones. Instead, as the story goes, AT&T opted for a tiered model where $15 allowed you to view 200 MB of funny cat .GIFs and $25 netted you 2 GB. Perhaps due to an early dose of holiday spirit, Verizon has decided to follow suit, but with a decidedly different twist. We can thank the maker (or maybe Lowell McAdams) for this one, but instead of canning their $30/unlimited data feature, they’ve decided to supplement it. For smartphone owners (smartphowners?) on a budget, Verizon is preparing to launch a $15 bolt-on feature that allows for 150 MB of data access for the month. “But wait a minute,” the math wiz reading this may say. “That LESS than what AT&T gives you for the same price!” Well done — basic arithmetic shows that the AT&T deal gives customers slightly more holler for their dollar. In fact, the whole situation requires a bit of cost-benefit analysis: Verizon gives you 50 fewer megabytes of bandwidth, but retains their unlimited data plan, whereas AT&T saves you five dollars on its upper-tier plan (unless you go over 2 GB, in which case you pay $10 for another 2).  The implications for you, the consumer, fall a bit outside the scope of a single, hideous run-on sentence. In any case, Verizon hasn’t officially announced the start of the plan, but sources say it’s to begin as a promotion that will last “through at least the end of December”. My internal optimist thinks it’ll be a great way for budget-conscious consumers to get the phone they want at a price they can afford, but the cynic in me sees it as a ploy to move smartphones at a steady clip during the holidays. Guess which one is usually right? Edit: The author (i.e. me) made an erroneous claim about AT&T offering free tethering with its 2 GB DataPro plan. He is very sorry, and is currently accepting donations of eggs to be applied liberally to his face. [ Reuters , via Phandroid ]

"Hike, India’S Mobile Messaging Upstart, Expands Language Support & Adds Offline Messaging, Stickers & More To Fuel Growth

There’s no room at the digital inn for more mobile messaging apps , but that’s not stopping them crowding in. Hike , an Indian mobile messaging app that’s only been around six months but has amassed more than five million registered users in that time, is doubling down on its home market while expanding its accessibility further afield too. Version 2.2 of the hike app adds support for four new languages — Spanish, French, Russian, and Portuguese — building out the previously supported two: English and German. The company said it plans to aggressively expand its language support each month as it chases after scale. And, evidently, as it chases competitors such as Japan’s Line which is also expanding into global markets such as Europe and LatAm. “We’re targeting those languages which we’ve seen the most demand for,” says the company. “With these languages, and English and German already supported, we’ll be supporting approximately more than 85% of the world’s mobile population. In addition to this, we’ll also be adding support for four new languages every month.” Interestingly, hike does not yet support any Indian languages owing to the linguistic landscape being so diverse, with more than 15 major languages spoken across the region. It does plan to start tackling this though, with Hindu support likely coming next to cover off a significant chunk of the population. It also intends to build native Indian language support and keyboards for all major languages into its app so it doesn’t have to depend on the OS/device (OS fragmentation is another big issue in the region). “We’ll probably be launching Hindi support next (which’d cover a significant portion of the Indian population), as well as some other top languages. You can expect much deeper local language support in the coming months,” it says. As well as extending its global reach by bolstering language support, the new version of the hike app adds a feature hike is hoping will give it serious uplift in its home market. Offline messages is an SMS conversation tech the company told TechCrunch about back in May . The feature allows users in India to keep in touch, regardless of whether the person they are sending a message to has 3G data enabled or not because messages are converted to SMS for delivery if there’s no viable data connection. Other new features in v2.2 of hike’s app include, somewhat inevitably, sticker packs — showing how hike is following in the footsteps of messaging competitors such as Line and Viber by sharpening its entertainment credentials. As Line has, hike has launched its own brand characters in sticker form, along with various other types of sharable imagery such as “expressions, rage faces, and some localised stickers targeted specifically at the Indian market”. This slideshow requires JavaScript. “It’s been around 15 hours since we launched, and we’re seeing the usage of stickers increase every hour. We’ll easily hit more than one million stickers shared on Day 1,” it says. “We expect it to grow significantly, both organically and through some innovative marketing efforts that we’ve lined up to take them mass market in India.” For now hike’s stickers are free but it intends to launch paid packs to monetise the feature in future — as Line has successfully been doing . “We do expect stickers to become a significant revenue stream going forward,” it says, but adds that its focus is not yet on revenue. For the moment, hike’s focus is on building out features to help it grow, since occupying such a competitive space as messaging absolutely necessities maintaining momentum — or the risk is to fall by the wayside as rivals streak ahead. Other new features introduced in v2.2 of hike include a mode called Last Seen, which allows users to share with chosen friends when they were last online. Hike also says it has improved the operation of a Walkie-Talkie feature — which it notes offers an accessible messaging option to Indian users who can’t use an English keyboard — to make that easier to use. “After this update, we plan to add a couple of really good features geared mostly towards growth and in-app engagement. We’ve observed that personalized content drives conversations, and we’ll leverage that in a very clever way soon to drive conversations on hike. We also plan to ride existing social networks and bring groups of friends on hike,” it adds.

"Dear Dreamcast…A Love Letter

 Last week marked the ten-year anniversary of Sega’s semi-defunct Dreamcast console, so I’ve decided to gush fanboy-style over what is my favorite gaming system. Sure, I love the NES, the Super Nintendo, and I even have fond memories of my old Colecovision; nothing makes me smile more, however, than the oft misunderstood Dreamcast.  It wasn’t the first disc-based system that I owned, so why am I so fixated by Sega’s last resort system? Perhaps it’s because the Dreamcast was the first console that I had pre-ordered.  Not at a brick-and-mortar Babbage’s or Funcoland, but through the burgeoning utopia known as the Internet. I remember receiving the UPS box early on the morning of September 9, 1999.   It was more exciting than watching music videos on TBS on Saturday nights waiting for Huey Lewis and the News’ Doing It All For My Baby to air.  The pre-order was only available in bundles, the least expensive of which included 3 games, the system, and a VMU.  I ended up with Sonic Adventure (awesome), Ready 2 Rumble Boxing (semi-awesome), and the Resident Evil clone Blue Stinger (not-awesome-at-all).  I skipped class and spent the day with old friends (Sonic and his buddies).  I marveled at the real-time bruise effects in Ready 2 Rumble .  I wished I had bought Soul Caliber instead of Blue Stinger .  It was a respectable launch, all told.    The Dreamcast was the first of the 6th-gen (128-bit) systems, so the graphics were a definite sight to behold.  The experience was akin to popping in a DVD after watching a VHS tape.  Everything was just clearer .  It was as close as you could get to having an arcade machine in your home (without dropping a small fortune on a Neo-Geo).  And with the near-perfect arcade port of Soul Caliber available, it really was an arcade machine, sans quarter slots and sticky buttons.  I found myself longing for more of these arcade experiences as the year went on.  I found solace in games like Crazy Taxi , Dead or Alive 2 , and the uber-awesome Marvel vs. Capcom and its sequel.  I guess the reason I fell in love with the DC is because I had so many “firsts” with it.  It was my first truly “next-gen” system, my first home arcade-box, and it introduced me to several new types of games.  There was the weirdness of the Leonard Nimoy narrated evolution simulator, Seaman and the ultra-emotional, engrossing, fork-lift driving revenge simulation of Shenmue. My love for music-rhythm games even blossomed through the cute and catchy seeds planted by Space Channel 5 , as well as my love for music- themed games like David Bowie’s opus, Omikron: The Nomad Soul .  Oh, and don’t forget that the greatest film of all time ( Evil Dead 2 ) made it’s video-game debut on the Dreamcast.  Sitting here thinking of my favorite games of the Dreamcast era, I’m beginning to feel those familiar butterflies of excitement deep in my gut.  Which I suppose is proof that I will always turn to my trusty DC for some of the most original and fun games of my life.  Much later, I discovered the wonders of emulation through Sega’s magic system.  In a pre-Virtual Console world, the DC was the best NES and SNES emulator around.  You could fit every 8-bit game ever made on one CD-R (complete with manuals and screen shots) and relive your most frustrating moments to your heart’s content.  There was and still is a vibrant homebrew scene among Dreamcast fanatics; a community has developed with the goal of nurturing and revering an often overlooked system.  Heck, there are a few brave companies that are even releasing new games .  It’s weird to know that I can still pre-order a game for the DC in 2009.  It’s hard to believe that ten years have passed since Sega sang their hardware swan song.  If only Sega of Japan had held out another six months, the face of the gaming landscape may be different today.  Sony is still supporting the PS2, which launched just a year after the Dreamcast.  Game consoles have long tails, but the initial sales hump must be crossed before the rewards can be seen.  Only now is Sony finding success with the PS3, and they’ll likely support it for another 8 years.  I know, I sound bitter.  Retrospection for games-gone-by always gets me fired up.  Thanks for listening to me gush.  I’m turning off “fanboy” mode now.  All is normal.

"Paypal Lawsuit Against Google Reveals Recruiting Saga And A Deal Gone Sour

Google is making a bold play to enter mobile payments , and PayPal doesn’t like it one bit.  Shortly after Google announced its new mobile wallet for Android phones today, Paypal filed a lawsuit against Google and two former PayPal executives who now are in charge of mobile payments at Google ( Osama Bedie r and Stephanie Tilenius ). The complaint (embedded below) alleges “misappropriation of trade secrets, and “breach of fiduciary duty.”  It revolves around Osama Bedier, who was the VP of Platform, Mobile, and New Ventures at PayPal before he was recruited to work at Google by Android chief Andy Rubin, Google co-founder Larry Page, and Bedier’s former PayPal colleague Stephanie Tilenius (who now heads up Commerce and Payments at Google, and I interviewed yesterday onstage at Disrupt NYC). The lawsuit reveals that Google was negotiatiating with PayPal for two years to power payments on mobile devices.  But just as the deal was about to be signed, Google backed off and instead hired the PayPal executive negotiating the deal—Bedier.  The lawsuit lays out the sequence of events: Bedier was offered a job at Google on October 31.  He didn’t take it immediately, but after a few months of back and forth, he finally accepted the job in January, 2011.  All of this coincided with Larry Page taking over as CEO, and a shift in Google’s strategy to build instead of partner in mobile payments. The lawsuit notes that Bedier knew all of PayPal’s future plans for mobile payments, as well as an internal detailed analysis of Google’s weaknesses in the area.  Not only that, it accuses him of storing “confidential eBay information in locations such as his non-PayPal computers, non-PayPal e-mail account, and an account on the remote computing service called ‘DropBox.'” What did Bedier do with all of these “trade secrets”?  The implication is that he used his knowledge of PayPal’s strategy to craft Google’s mobile wallet strategy (yup, the same one revealed today).  He also used that knowledge to sell Google’s mobile wallet to big retailers: And finally, he actively recruited other PayPal employees, just as Tilenius helped to recruit him (which is why she is named in the suit as well).  Assuming this thing gets settled before it goes to court, how much is hiring Bedier going to end up costing Google? Update 5/27 :  I asked Google for a comment last night about this lawsuit.  Today, a spokesperson gave me this statement: “Silicon Valley was built on the ability of individuals to use their knowledge and expertise to seek better employment opportunities, an idea recognized by both California law and public policy. We respect trade secrets, and will defend ourselves against these claims.” Photo credit: Flickr/ Henk-Jan Winkeldermaat

"Digital Contents Expo Tokyo: Awesome ""Time And Space Mapping Software""

The Tokyo Polytechnic University has showcased c-loc at this year’s Digital Contents Expo , a spectacular mapping software for “time and space” that runs on a touch screen. The technology looks super-futuristic, and it not only works but is actually useful, too. The idea is to visualize geographical and chronological data via 3D graphics and let users easily access and alter the data they see via a touch screen. c-loc can cover text-based information, images, sounds and videos. You can use it to visualize how a certain building (space) evolves over the years (time), for example. The makers target archeologists, historians, urban researchers and others with their product. Here are two videos I took of the mapping software in action at the event yesterday. Video 1: http://blip.tv/play/hMQ5gaqZZwI%2Em4v Video 2: http://blip.tv/play/hMQ5gaqdLgI%2Em4v

"  Blue’S Yeti Usb Mic Will Ship With A Copy Of ‘Watchdogs 2’ For Some Reason

I’ve always considered Blue’s USB microphones a podcasting tool — and I suspect Blue has, as well. They’re easy to use, they sound good and they’re affordable. Heck, I recorded my bit of the last TechCrunch podcast on a Snowball. The mics have also made a splash in the gaming community, presumably for all of the reasons mentioned above. To really drive the point home, Blue is teaming up with Ubisoft to bundle Watchdogs 2 with the Blackout version of its excellent Yeti mic. No word on exact timing, only that the bundle is coming in the next couple of months, priced the same as the standalone version of the USB microphone. At the very least, it should be out just in time for the holiday shopping season.

"Roamer Makes It Easier To Make Calls From Foreign Climes

A month ago in Barcelona I met with one of the founders of Roamer , a clever SIM hack/app that allows you to bring your own phone number along with you around the world. The company raised £300,000 in December and is closing a £1 million with the Angel Co-fund and UK Angels. So how does it work? The Roamer app allows you to make calls cheaply anywhere in the world. When you’re ready to travel, you tell Roamer your local, home phone number and then buy an international SIM card. Any calls to your home number are forwarded to a local number in the country you’re visiting and you answer them just as you would at home, paying local rates instead of exorbitant roaming ones. The founding team, Simon Rabin, Petr Antropov and Nick Ustinov, all have experience in European telecom startups, and Rabin created one of the first mobile checkout apps called Txt2Buy. Ustinov founded inbox.lv, Latvia’s first big exit. The idea is fairly compelling – you basically subvert roaming charges with a few clever hacks – and it’s great for Europeans abroad. The company is working on a version for the U.S. and will start shipping SIMs for users who don’t want to mess with picking up local cards. They have about 3,000 users and processed 250,000 minutes of calls so far. The company hopes to disrupt companies like HolidayPhone who simply send you a SIM card before you leave for your trip. Because your calls are routed to your local SIM, for example, loved ones can stay in touch no matter where you are. Roaming charges are usually onerous, and this makes them less so. It’s an interesting small startup and definitely an interesting idea.

"Military Plans To Shoot Rogue Satellite Out Of The Sky

[photopress:satshoot.jpg,full,center] We’re gonna shoot that rogue satellite out of the sky. How clutch is that? Yup, the president just gave the go-ahead to knock that now-broken satellite right out of the sky. The satellite, which the military hasn’t had control of since its launch in December 2006, is predicted to fall back to Earth the first week of March. Rather than risk having the bus-sized object careen toward civilization—predicting where it would land is pretty difficult—we’re gonna go the Armageddon route. It’s the first time a missile will be used to bring down a satellite and no one knows the chances of its success. Apparently, though, after much analysis, taking a chance is better than not. I cannot wait. Grab some popcorn, boys and girls. US Plans to Shoot Down Broken Satellite [AP/Breitbart via Drudge ]

"Holy Smokes: Fatale: Exploring Salome Edition

Logging into PayPal for the first time in months this morning, I sent Tale of Tales $7 of my completely unearned money. It was $7 well spent. I bought Fatale: Exploring Salome , and I guess you can call it a game, but it’s not some mindless Halo or Madden nonsense. (Look at me, going after the big targets.) It’s just weird. Weird but great. I’ve never played Myst , but I assume it’s a little bit like this, only Myst is a little more game-y. Fatale: Exploring Salome a first-person adventure game the explores Oscar Wilde’s Salome , a play about the biblical story of Salome. So already you know the game is different; how many games have you played that are based on a Bible story? Do me a favor and look up the Dance of the Seven Veils . If the game comes across a little like Silent Hill , that’s because the characters were designed Takayoshi Sato , that series’ character designer. That’s a good thing. I don’t know, I’m all over the place here. The game is just so unique that’s it’s hard to discuss in an intelligent manner. I can’t, at least; I’m not Edge , that’s for sure. But I do know that plenty of people talk about supporting independent developers, and I can think of no better way to do such a thing. There’s a Mac and PC version, which is also helpful.

"Sevone P2P Sharing And Big Data Clusters For Monitoring On A Massive Scale

I come across these companies that you might not think are super fascinating. But it is often through these technical providers that you get a sense for the bigger market, how business models are changing and the new role of data as an indicator of a cloud’s overall health. A case in point is SevOne . The company uses P2P networking and big data clusters to help companies do real-time management of their massive infrastructures. Today they announced an update to their appliance. Legacy providers are often ill fitted to monitoring big data, thousands of mobile and the new massive loads on networks. In legacy environments, it may require a network administrator to look at several servers to get data for monitoring. The new SevOne service can monitor millions of objects in real-time across all networking technologies through a web interface. The P2P environment means the appliances are aware of each other when they go online. A company may have 15 appliances spread across its network in different geographic regions.  This means it can show data and its behavior in different scenarios. This is the new face of the cloud. It’s about predicting if there will be problems on the network by monitoring the data from thousands of points on the network.. The companies that need this kind of monitoring are the likes of Thomson Reuters. It counts on SevOne to manage the health of its network so it can deliver financial information in seconds to financial services firms. But it’s the business model that is most intriguing. SevOne charges $5 per element. Essentially it analyzes the machine generated data from the network environment. You only get charged for the elements you use. Monitored elements can include but are not limited to: network interfaces, response-time measurements, CPUs and disk drives. SevOne is in a market of IT giants. Cisco, Dell and HP all have performance management services. Vmware could prove to be a formidable competitor as its cloud strategy matures. But SevOne has something different in its distributed infrastructure and the business model it uses.

"Harvest Power Raises Another $6 Million To Turn Food And Yard Scraps Into Energy, Or Fertilizer

Harvest Power, a company that makes energy and fertilizer products from organic waste, added $6 million to its series B, $51.7 million round, with Rabobank’s SAM Private Equity group, which focuses on sustainability investing and is based in Zurich, Switzerland, joined the company’s other backers: Generation Investment Management, DAG Ventures,  Keating Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Waste Management (NYSE: WM), Munich Venture Partners, and TriplePoint Capital. As Harvest Power CEO Paul Sellew told TechCrunch in March, the company will put the capital into building two, large biomass renewable energy projects — demo facilities —  in Richmond, B.C. and another outside of Toronto. At these sites, the company will test new technology that they will use to process organic waste and turn it into fertilizers and energy at a lower cost than anaerobic digesters that are currently available. [Update, May 24, 2011 1:45 p.m. ET] The company is also investing in a bit of green tech promotion, or as they call it a “knowledge sharing initiative” called SSO Superheroes . The program profiles fresh examples of projects, and people who are doing interesting things to recycle source-separated organics around North America.

"Task Management App Asana Raises $50M At A $600M Valuation Led By Yc’S Sam Altman

Asana , an enterprise app that lets people set and track projects and other goals, has hit a goal of its own: today, the company is announcing that it has raised $50 million. The Series C round — led by Y-Combinator’s Sam Altman — values the company at $600 million, the company tells me. As a bit of context, Asana last raised $28 million in 2012; that Series B was at a $280 million valuation , according to our sources. Co-founded in 2009 by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and early FB employee Justin Rosenstein out of the belief, in their own words, that “every team in the world is capable of accomplishing bigger goals, and that software could help empower them to drive work forward with more ease, clarity, and accountability,” the company will be using the funds to continue building out Asana’s functionality (more on that below) and also expand its customer base internationally (it’s largely a US-based list of clients today). Asana today has 13,000 paying businesses as customers, up from 10,000 in September, and over 140,000 businesses using the product overall adding some 10,000 every month. The company has both free and premium tiers , with the latter charged at $8.33 per member per month for groups above 15, and for more features. Moskovitz and Rosenstein say that for the past four years, annual recurring revenue has been “more than doubling”, and that the company is on track to profitability in the next few years. “This fundraising is the fuel we need to get to the next stage, and to accelerate the fulfillment of our mission,” the founders note. In addition to Altman (who said he has wanted to invest in the company “for a long time”) this round includes a long list of other very high-profile backers — a testament both to the founders’ own pedigrees but also Asana’s place as one of the more respected and used startups in the productivity/enterprise apps space. They include 8VC (Joe Lonsdale’s new VC firm post Formation 8); Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund (which led Asana’s Series B ); Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan (respectively CEOs of Facebook and The Primary School); Tony Hsieh (Zappos’ CEO and Vegas visionary); Andrew Mason (Detour CEO and Groupon co-founder); Adam D’Angelo of Quora; Aditya Agarwal and Ruchi Sanghvi; Eric Ries (Lean Startup author); Roger McNamee (Elevation Partners’ founder); and Moskovitz and Rosenstein themselves. The two point out that these investors’ businesses are Asana users, and the individuals use it, too, with some funny side notes. Dropbox VP Aditya Agarwal and Dropbox alum Ruchi Sanghvi “use Asana to manage their domesticity”; and Mason’s fervour, meanwhile, is so strong that he “makes us look lukewarn on this whole Asana thing.” As more businesses move their work processes online — creating documents and other data in apps like Quip or Google Docs or Microsoft through; communicating with each other (think Slack or Yammer) — productivity apps are having a moment right now. Just last week, BetterWorks — another platform that helps workers set and manage tasks and goals — announced a Series B of $20 million . Indeed, in addition to BetterWorks and Asana itself, there are others like Basecamp, Wrike and Trello all offering ways to boost productivity and help organize so-called knowledge workers (essentially, those tied to keyboards or screens to get their jobs done). That makes for a competitive landscape but also a sign of how there is a ripe opportunity to do more. For its part, Asana has been testing a beta of a product called Track Anything , which sounds like a dashboard-style product that will let people automatically signal to colleagues jobs for completing tasks without them having to do the legwork. In a working world where we are forever multitasking and may be more intent on getting things done rather than ticking and updating progress reports to let people know that we have, adding in automation seems to be an essential development. This is a challenge that others are tackling, too. BetterWorks is building integrations with whatever software use most, which in turn communicates our progress on a task in the background.

"Court Sides With Fcc'S ""Porting"" Decision, Rejects Verizon'S (Whiny) Arguments

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has upheld (pdf) a FCC decision finding that Verizon’s use of proprietary information of rival companies for marketing purposes violates federal law. To make more sense out of this holding, we’ve gotta back up a few steps. When a customer informs her carrier that she plans to switch operators, the consumer’s current company puts out a notification to assist in transferring (aka porting) her existing number over to a new service. Apparently, Verizon had been offering customers sweetened deals to stay with the Nation’s #2 telecommunications company once it learned that the particular customer was planning to defect. After learning about these shady dealings last year, Comcast, Time Warner, and Bright House Networks called upon the FCC to investigate Verizon’s actions, arguing that they violated the U.S. Telecommunications Act’s restrictions on the use of rivals’ proprietary information for marketing purposes. The FCC agreed, issuing a decision stating that the intention of the federal law was to ensure the losing carrier played a neutral role in transferring a customer’s phone number. Verizon then moved to challenge the FCC decision, arguing that it put Verizon at an unfair disadvantage. Then, two days ago, the Court of Appeals sided with the FCC, holding that the regulatory body’s interpretation of the particular section (222(b) to be exact) of the Telecommunications Act was reasonable and rejected Verizon’s challenge. This ruling will effectively prevent all communications companies from actively trying to persuade customers to reconsider their pending move to a new service. Too bad it won’t stop these same companies from providing spotty coverage and terrible customer support… [via Reuters ]

"Windshield-Mounted Gps Units No Longer Outlawed In California

[Pic Source: Marcin Wichary ] Realizing that a little 6 inch obstruction on the windshield is probably a better solution than forcing people to take their eyes off the road , the State of California will once again allow windshield-mounted GPS units when the new year rolls through. Taking a break from solving economic crises and fighting crime, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger put his penned blessing on the bill over the weekend. You can’t just go plopping your GPS unit wherever you want, however – as we understand it, you can stick it anywhere within 5-inches of the lower left corner of the windshield, or 7-inches of the lower right corner. Lower right corner? Does anybody actually do that? Come January 1st, 2009 you’ll be free to roam without having to choose between getting lost and driving blind. Just don’t text at the same time.

"New York Gets Another Learn To Code Academy

New York is getting a new tech skills training academy. The twist it that the just launched academy is being created by a dev studio drawing on their existing expertise making apps for others to teach budding entrepreneurs the web development skills they’re going to need to turn their big idea into a big business. At a price, of course. The dev studio in question, HappyFunCorp , says its new HappyFunAcademy stands out from other local players in the learn-to-code space — such as Flatiron School and App Academy — because of the real-world business experience it will be bringing to class. TL;DR It’s a coding academy for people who want to make apps taught by people who actually do make apps. Indeed, part of the incentive for HFC to start the academy is the difficulty it has in finding enough skilled developers to fuel a growing business, according to co-founder Ben Schippers. “We can’t actually hire people fast enough,” he tells TechCrunch. “It’s a great business, it’s doing very well, it’s growing unbelievably quickly.” HFC’s client roster includes the likes of American Express , (TechCrunch corporate overlord) AOL , Bloomberg , Citi , LinkedIn , McGrawHill, MoMA, Scribd, Verisign, Victoria’s Secret and The Webby Awards, to name a few. It’s planning to draw on that network to help graduates of its Academy find jobs at the end of their course — and, indeed, is likely to be cherrypicking promising candidates itself. “Selfishly the tech industry is growing and so is HFC and so selfishly we are look at the academy to do a very very fine-tuned recruiting. You can look at that way,” says Schippers. “The way in which we are going to teach you, if we do our job well… we should be able to hire people from the class. So we are really going to be under the spotlight for the first few classes to see how many of those students we can actually hire. Our goal will be to hire students  from that first class.” “It’s a no brainer for us to do this — then we can get pick of the litter and we can give them jobs,” he adds. “It also keeps us really honest because if we’re not able to pull from the Academy then we’re not really helping the services side of the business.” Are we in a bubble? If app makers can’t put their hands on enough skilled staff to meet demand — and believe they can get non-techie folk to pay to be upskilled so that they can fill their own empty tech seats, then yes we’re in a bubble. The new academy is not HFC’s first foray into teaching tech skills. It previously dipped its toes in the waters by teaching a “traditional engineering entrepreneur course” at Bates college in Maine. But Schippers says it wanted to try its hand at shaping an entire course without having to fit within a traditional academic curriculum so that the focus on skills learnt could be entirely within a business application perspective. “Instead of working with all of these colleges to figure out how to write the curriculum for them, we said let’s just do it ourself. The class that we taught was the way in which we coach or teach entrepreneurs that come through HFC as a business. And we said there’s a really great opportunity here to take all of our learnings over the years of building the software and wrap a really great coding curriculum around that,” he says. “That is really a huge differentiator between what we do and what the couple of other schools are doing.” “In our little world there are a couple of people doing similar things. In the grand scheme of things there’s not nearly enough seats to fill all the students. The demand is really high,” he adds. “Within HFC we have product architects, we have visual designers, we have user experience designers, and we have all of the front end and back end engineers so within this large curriculum that we wrote what we’re going to be able to do is we’re going to be able to on a daily or weekly basis, bring in key stakeholders from the services business and have them actually go through real-life examples of problems that they have had to encounter on a weekly basis. And so it’s a very, very, very hands on approach to teaching software engineering.” Schippers concedes that Thoughtbot is doing “something sort of similar” to its new HFC Academy — being as they are also an engineering firm “first and foremost”. “They are really the closest to us but if you look at Flatiron or if you look at App Academy, what you’ll see is those curriculums are great, and they make a lot of sense, and a lot of what they’re doing were going to be doing as well — but the missing pieces in those curriculums are the inherent, day-to-day opportunities of the real-life exposure coming in to the academy,” he adds. “It’s a lot more learning by doing vs just learning.” Discussing how the Academy compares with incubators or mentoring programs, he says the price point is “very competitive” (albeit incubator programs are usually ‘paying’ the startups to be part of the program via an investment) but also stresses that it’s more of a class environment than you’d get at an incubator. “This is much more of a class. You’re paying to come in, to have a desk and from nine to 12 in the morning you, deep immersion, and then from one til five you work. So it’s a full time class commitment with these sprinkles of real world practitioners being brought in,” he adds. “Y Combinator and Tech Stars… what they do really well is the exact opposite of what Flatiron does well. What Flatiron does really well is full immersion across the board. It’s just you’re learning how to code, and that’s really what you’re doing. With YC it’s ‘ok you already have a business idea and we’re going to help put people in front of you to help you push that idea through’. And with us, we’re saying we should blend both of those — and that’s what people are doing to be paying for.” Who exactly is the program for? Schippers says the philosophical thrust is to serve a growing demand among graduates of liberal arts degrees who have found decreasing demand for their ‘soft skills’ vs the job market of 25 years+ ago — and who are therefore looking for ways to upskill after formal education, with a focus on gaining technology skills (and specifically skills that can help them get jobs). “People are really having a hard time getting jobs, and that has been the movement of the learn to code movement. Technology has been one of these growth sectors where there’s so much growth right now and there aren’t enough people,” he says. “It’s the people who are graduating from school or into their late twenties and thirties and they’ve realised that they graduated with some degree and they don’t really like their job anymore — and what they really want to do is they want to get involved in technology. That is going to be the demographic of the first couple of classes.” “There’s a huge opportunity for these highly educated and motivated people to start making money in technology. They just need help getting started,” he adds. The first class at the HFC Academy starts in September, and only some 15 souls will get tapped for the inaugural program — likely to last around six weeks. The cost for learning code from HFC’s coders starts at $3,500, stepping up (within three weeks) to circa $5,000. Participants will be taught Ruby on Rails, HTML, JavaScript — aka the skills required to become a web developer, says Schippers. “They will be learning all of the progressive tools needed to begin the conversation of getting a job in technology. To begin the conversation of continuing to learn in the field of technology — that is the whole mission of these classes. You should be able to graduate and a business for instance like HFC should be able to hire you. That’s the whole idea,” he adds. HFC is taking applications for the first class now, and will be doing some selection — based on ensuring that a class has the right profile of participants, according to Schippers. “We’re going to be looking at the class as much more of a unit [than other tech academies might]… We’re going to be trying to get those 15 students profiled the right way, so from different backgrounds, from different jobs,  from different education areas,” he adds. In January the length of the class is likely to extend to eight or ten weeks, and the Academy will be adding a scholarship program to help underprivileged inner city kids get places within the Academy — likely one or two seats per class will be offered on a scholarship basis, in partnership with the city of New York. While the initial focus for HFC’s Academy is on New York, where its services business is headquartered, Schippers sees potential to spread the initiative to other cities in time — naming the likes of Austin, Texas as another potential “hotbed” for tech skills demand. The northern mid west is another possibility — “the Twin Cities, and/or Chicago and maybe even Boston”. Also increasingly interesting in the tech skills demand area is the UK. “It’s really hard to ignore the UK right now,” says Schippers. “I think there’s definitely an opportunity there. People just need to do a little more research to figure out where the right pockets are to do something like this.”

"Guest Post: How We Got Hubpages To Scale

Editor’s note: This is a guest post by HubPages CEO Paul Edmondson on how Hubpages succeeded in amassing visitors. After the recent TechCrunch post about HubPages, we received several questions about how HubPages got to 39 million unique visitors per month.  Here’s how we did it: Four years ago, during our launch in August 2006, we wanted to do three main things to create a successful social content community: first, we wanted to make it easy for authors to create a one-page topical website; second, we wanted to drive traffic to the author’s content; and third, we wanted to share the majority of the revenue back with the author. We had planned for natural search to be a major source of traffic, but it wasn’t until November of 2006 that we started to get measurable traffic from search engines.  To this day, we continue to refine our platform to help authors on HubPages to have the best opportunity to show up in the natural search results.  One of the key metrics we learned was about the longevity of content.  Content created on HubPages peaks in traffic on average nearly three years after it’s created.  This knowledge helped our business become more predictable.  For the author, creating a HubPages article is like putting a little bit of money in the bank that is going to increase its value over the next three years and then continue at that level for the foreseeable future.  The large quantity of content that was created early in the life of HubPages dramatically increased in revenue over 3 years, and allowed us to continue to grow the company. We became a metrics focused company.  The two key drivers of our business are Hub production and revenue per thousand Hub views.  Based on these drivers, we developed a model that allowed us to do sophisticated micro-marketing including search engine marketing to attract writers.  Through analysis of Hubs created by new authors, our models are able to predict a close estimate of the traffic and revenue that a new author will generate over various time intervals. This prediction model has been significant in our growth. In the early days, we decided we didn’t want to be the arbiter of quality or try to control what people wrote, but we soon discovered that high-quality authors and advertisers did not feel comfortable with the fully open publishing platform that included adult content. So, in July of 2007, about a year after our launch, we modified our terms of service and took leading steps in the social content category to become a porn-free site.  The short-term impact was over a 30% drop in traffic, but it reaped long term gains.  We also continued to build anti-spam technologies and put in place requirements for publishing on HubPages that improves the overall quality. Then we wanted to give insight to authors about the type of content we saw working well on HubPages so that they could earn more. We started hosting contests about writing on evergreen topics.  We started incorporating analytics into each page of the site that showed authors their traffic sources. We continue to invest in specialty tools that teach authors what pages to link to with the Interlinking Tool and how to refine the titles of their Hubs with the Title Tuner Beta.  By taking the data we collected, and putting it inline with the tools, authors became more successful on our platform. HubPages is a set of technologies, but we really are about authors.  We took pro-writer stances by letting the author choose what they wanted to write on, and giving them ownership of their content, so that the revenue they earn can increase over time.  As the author community grew, we built features that fostered communication – like the ability to follow and compliment other authors.  As a result, HubPages’ reputation as a writing community continues to grow. Now, going on our fifth year of business and with nearly 140% growth in the last 12 months in terms of visitors, I can see the site growing well into the future based on our three original tenets of making it easy to create content, driving traffic and sharing the revenue.

"Reddit’S Co-Founders Move On To New Pastures

 Reddit co-founders Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian are leaving the crowd-sourced news service when their contracts end on Oct. 31.  The pair helped found the social news site four years ago , and it was a promising competitor to Digg but never got quite the same traction. So it went open-source last year , after being acquired by Conde Nast (the parent company to Wired) in 2006. Based in Boston and backed by YCombinator, the group moved west after the sale.  Ohanian wrote in a goodbye post:  “After more than four years of thinking about reddit every day — it’s been more therapeutic than you know, actually — there’s bound to be some postpartum depression (and the only prescription, is more reddit). This is a special community that’s become a bigger part of my life than I ever could have imagined; I’m grateful for the opportunity to have worked with you all (except for the spammers).”  Ohanian’s going off to Armenia to serve as a Kiva fellow while Huffman says he’ll go to Virginia to spend time with his wife. A third Reddit programmer, Chris Slowe , is staying on even though his contract will also end. Huffman and Ohanian said the site will continue to operate as usual after they leave.

"With Masspay, Dwolla Takes On Paypal By Offering Lower Fees, Support For More Recipients

Following a recent partnership with mFoundry which saw digital cash network Dwolla introducing more tools for banking partners, the startup is on the move again with the launch of a new service designed to encourage adoption among business customers. Called “ MassPay ,” Dwolla’s latest addition offers businesses a faster and simpler alternative to check-writing and wire transfers, by allowing them to pay up to 2,000 people at once. As of launch time, Dwolla has lined up 10 partners who have agreed to integrate MassPay into their current business practices. Many of these are startups, like parking space rental service Parking Panda, which will use MassPay to pay its own partners (garage and lot owners). Meanwhile, social car-sharing service Getaround will use the service to pay car owners, Flashnotes will use it to pay note sellers, and Fancy Hands will pay assistants, to name a few. Other partners include Major League Gaming, Splash, VHX, HTML5.com, Webmasterchecks, and Scripted. MassPay is powered by Dwolla’s cash payments network, and as per usual, that means costs of $0.25 per transaction over $10, while transactions under $10 remain free. Because of the way Dwolla’s system works, businesses are able to make these payments without having to store customer’s sensitive financial information on their own servers. To use the service, the partner businesses create a Dwolla account, then upload a CSV file with two columns: the amount they want to pay and the email address, phone number or Dwolla ID of the recipients. The introduction of Dwolla’s MassPay service is a clear shot across the bow of payments giant PayPal, whose own Mass Pay offering supports up to 250 recipients, and charges 2% for each payment, capped at $1 per payment. Like Dwolla, PayPal also offers a web upload function, in its case a text file or tab-delimited file like Excel. However, PayPal also offers an API for this feature in order to automate the payments, which means the recipient limit is not as much of a concern, since there doesn’t necessarily have to be as much manual labor involved for businesses that operate at scale. In order to kick off the service’s launch, Dwolla is offering businesses the ability to try Mass Pay for free, and will reimburse the first 5 payments made between now and November 30th.

Fortunately Facebook has had the foresight to release the new API with a complimentary new feature — you’ll now be able to block the parent application of any of these quizzes, which means you can hide many of them from your News Feed with one click of the ‘Hide’ button. For those who haven’t tried out one of these quiz apps, here’s a refresher.  There are a number of very popular quiz generators on Facebook that let people create their own, secondary applications that they can share with their friends.  But actually going through the process has been a bit tricky — users had to deal with Facebook’s developer app and API keys, which is hardly familiar territory for the vast majority of Facebook users (though many made it through the process anyway).  The new API eliminates much of this hassle, allowing quiz makers to automate the application creation process.  And that means we’re going to be seeing lots more quizzes. Of course, many of us aren’t exactly keen on seeing countless quizzes filling up our News Feed.  This wouldn’t be a problem if they acted the same way as most applications do — after all, you can hide any application from your News Feed.  But because each quiz is treated as a unique app, you have to manually hide each new quiz that one of your friends makes.  At least, until now. Now you’ll be able to block all quizzes from the parent Quiz Generator applications, which means you’ll be able to hide many of them at once without having to deal with them again.  It will be interesting to se what the net effect on the quiz makers will be: they’ll be easier to use than ever, but it’s also much easier to ignore them. Aside from its importance to Quiz Makers, the new API has plenty of other uses.  Developers on Facebook will now more easily be able to offer self-serve custom app generators (for example, you could build an application that sports teams could use to build their own branded applications).  The API can also be used by services like Disqus to further streamline integrating Facebook Connect on sites outside of Facebook. Photo by alexanderdrachmann .

"The Promise, Progress And Pain Of Collaboration Software

Editor’s note:  Jason Green is a founder and general partner at Emergence Capital Partners . He was an early investor in Yammer and Success Factors, and he currently sits on the boards of ServiceMax, Replicon, Cotap, Lotame, Xad, Digital Airstrike, and Box (observer). Truly effective enterprise collaboration applications represent one of the most promising opportunities for cloud computing. Over the last decade, several SaaS companies have emerged that improve workplace collaboration, including well-known companies like Box and Yammer , as well as newer companies such as Quip , Cotap , Hall and Slack . Given my board roles with several of these companies, I am often asked about what is working and what is next. I want to share my thoughts on the promise and the progress in collaboration software while also touching on the areas of opportunity or the pain. Emergence Capital Partners started with a thesis that software as a service would change the way that employees collaborated. We anticipated that connected employees would increasingly rely on always-updated cloud solutions to interact with each other, reducing the communication challenges of modern distributed work environments. These challenges, documented in 1988 by sociologist Johansen in his ground-breaking CSCW Matrix , require different types of solutions depending on whether communication is happening at the same time or is asynchronous, and whether communication takes place face-to-face or remotely. Cloud solutions have been particularly effective at tackling the challenge of helping employees who work together remotely. For example, Yammer built a business social networking platform to help employees feel more connected to each other, no matter where they worked. Box has dramatically simplified the previously complex task of working on a set of shared documents from multiple devices across multiple locations. Google Hangouts and Skype offer multi-device, real-time video conferencing applications at a fraction of the previous cost. We are also starting to see a new set of mobile-first collaboration tools that offer mobile messaging in a work environment such as Biba and Remind101 . Applications such as Cotap enable one-to-one or one-to-many texting, which is particularly effective for time sensitive information for distributed employees. The good news is that these cloud collaboration companies are reducing friction in employee engagement, particularly for distributed employees. The bad news is that we are all dealing with information overload (“noise”) as an unwanted byproduct of increasingly friction-free communication.  Given the explosion of communication, conversations can take place simultaneously over several competing channels, creating confusion and inefficiency by requiring multiple changes in context. In addition, the ability to access prior content easily and seamlessly across all these communication channels becomes more challenging. When I think about areas of pain, I see several obvious opportunities: Most knowledge workers will tell you that their biggest challenge is extracting the signal from noise amidst all of the communication and collaboration options. Employers that deploy these solutions in a workplace need confidence that the highest priority items are breaking through the clutter. I can envision new solutions that help filter communication at both the individual and organizational levels. Here are some examples: I get excited about entrepreneurs who are using cloud technology to solve big problems for the enterprise. Consumer adoption of new communication applications are a great leading indicator of what professionals in the workplace will desire in the future. As VCs, our job is to find those applications that truly enhance corporate productivity and are amenable to the security, privacy and compliance needs of the enterprise. We have just uncovered the tip of the iceberg of the new forms of collaboration enabled by the cloud and mobile, and we can’t wait to work with the emerging enterprise leaders that will help solve these challenges.

"Bloomberg: ‘We’Re Going To Have More Visibility And Less Privacy,’ Drones And Surveillance Coming

“We’re going to have more visibility and less privacy. I don’t see how you stop that,” admitted New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a surprisingly candid interview about the future of the surveillance state in the Big Apple. While admitting that increased surveillance was “scary” and that governments will have to be thoughtful with their laws, he seemed to side with prioritizing radical transparency, especially through the use of automated drones, “but what’s the difference whether the drone is up in the air or on the building? I mean intellectually I have trouble making a distinction.” This puts Bloomberg squarely at odds with the growing number of states and congress members either enacting or proposing moratoriums on the use of drones. Indeed, he went on to imply that the fears against drones were somewhat unjustified, especially since security cameras already exist: The NY Daily news notes that the New York Civil Liberties union has identified roughly 2,4000 cameras already affixed on Manhattan buildings–a presence that is likely to increase if Bloomberg’s most recent interview is to be believed. Lest Bloomberg be labeled as a surveillience hawk, the interview took on a tone of inevitability , rather than advocacy: “Everybody wants their privacy, but I don’t know how you’re going to maintain it.” Listen to part of the interview with WOR-AM host John Gambling, below. We’ll have more analysis soon.

"Android Tablets Peel Away 20% Of Ipad’S Mega Market Share

 Android-based tablets have wrested away 20 percent of worldwide market share from the Apple iPad in the past 12 months, according to ABI Research .  Tablets running versions of Google’s Android OS include the semi-popular Samsung Galaxy Tab and Motorola Xoom (left), and today saw the release of a new one, with the Acer Iconia Tab A100 , the first 7-inch tablet running the latest Honeycomb version of Android. The sheer variety of Android tablets available, with different price points and features, makes it possible for these tablets to hit all segments of the market.  “If we look at Apple, they want to deliver one form factor,” Kevin Burden, vice president of mobile devices for ABI Research, told VentureBeat. “But with Android, manufacturers can differentiate and offer it at lower prices. The value of Android is choice.”  The Android tablet market growing similarly to how the Android smartphone market grew a few years ago. But despite the variety of tablet offerings, there is less demand for tablets than phones. Because of those two factors, no single tablet has had stand-out sales, and none of the tablets can compare sales-wise with the iPad, said ABI.  “Many vendors have introduced media tablets, but none are separating themselves from the pack to pose a serious threat to Apple,” said Jeff Orr, ABI Research mobile devices group director, in a statement. “In fact, most have introduced products at prices higher than similarly-configured iPads. Apple, never a company to be waiting for others, has introduced its second-generation iPad media tablet while keeping product pricing unchanged.”  Orr said consumers look somewhat less favorably on the Android tablet segment because of OS fragmentation and the introduction of lower-cost units that have fewer features.  “De-featured, low-cost media tablets are being introduced by more than 50 vendors in 2011,” Orr said. “This will certainly help bolster year-over-year growth for the category, but it also creates a negative perception in the minds of the mass consumer audience about the readiness of media tablets to be fully functional within the next several years.”  Although consumers may not favor Android tablets over the iPad, Android tablets’ market share could still rise considerably. Gartner projects that in 2015 the iPad will have 47.1 percent of the tablet market, while Android will jump to 38.6 percent. While I’m sure Google would like even higher numbers, those would be fairly big gains if the projection turns out accurate.  Do you think Android tablets will continue to rise up in market share? Could one end up seriously challenging the iPad?

"‘Humans’ Tv Show Raises Question Of How Human We Can Make Machines

 The big budget Channel 4/AMC series Humans is with us. It presents a world where “synths,” eerily life-like robots, become part of the household.  Humans isn’t just the new Twilight or Divergent, offering the story-telling freedom to shoot‘em, bite’em, kiss’em in an improbable apocalyptic fantasy world like Terminator. Instead, it raises some hugely important questions about artificial intelligence (AI) and our relationship with it.  Of course the opportunities afforded by AI haven’t escaped the entertainment makers: Her, Transcendence, Ex-Machina, and Chappie — and before that, iRobot, Terminator, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and many others. But concurrent to the debut of this new series, the world’s A-list brains are expressing their concern over artificial intelligence — Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, and Sir Tim Berners-Lee amongst them. Meanwhile, Nokia is spearheading a global debate called #maketechhuman to explore the relationship between technology and humankind. But why has this all blown up now?  The answer is because the theoretical questions about AI, around for decades and addressed for the first time by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics in the ‘40s, are suddenly very relevant again. Let’s use an example: Today’s aircraft have enough artificial intelligence to prevent the pilot putting the aircraft in danger, but that intelligence can be overruled by human beings. As the AI gets better, should that always be the case?  And this is just the beginning; can you imagination the nightmare litigious society where companies are sued because they didn’t put enough AI into the machine to prevent harm to humans? Can we see the day when machines can completely override humans and make decisions against their will?  This is not theoretical or big picture, we are already ascending the thin end of the wedge, AI doesn’t have to look like a robot; machines, in the form of algorithms, are already making decisions that affect people and shape society every day.  Upworthy Chief Executive Eli Pariser conducted an experiment using Google’s search engine. He asked people with very different interests – and therefore search histories – to search for “Egypt.” Those whose profile was more leisure oriented received links to holidays; those with more of a current affairs bias learned of the Middle East’s most bloody coup. This is a learning machine on its way to creating cultural ghettos.  Another example, termed Inadvertent Algorithmic Cruelty , is Facebook’s year-end summary troubles, which failed to recognize that not everyone wants to be reminded of what happened last year; life has tragedies as well as parties.  There is a huge growth in the use of technology to help brands manage their relationships with fans and customers, and we are already seeing the flaws in that. The corporate world should be heading towards what we refer to as “Human Era” — brands treating people as people — but the use of AI can send things the wrong way and make things much, much worse. The kind of organizations and brands that need to watch out for this especially are those whose product or service is low emotion, whose relationships are automated, and where category differentiation is low: banks, insurers, and energy and utility companies are the most obvious examples.  If relationships between organizations and individuals need to be more human, yet the management of those relationships becomes increasingly dependent upon technology, isn’t the only way forward to ensure that technology has human values in its DNA?  To make this happen we need to look at these questions: 1. Is it possible to give machines human values? 2. Can we agree on what those are? 3. Should the creators of AI be “compelled” to program them in? 4. What is the mechanism for making this happen; government? 5. Would we allow exceptions such as military drones?  As of today I would guess the answers to these questions, at least in the U.S., tend towards: 1. Yes 2. No 3. Yes and no 4. Absolutely no idea 5. Definitely  Bill Gates et al are alarmed, but not in my view alarmist. We cannot afford to sleepwalk into a world where we cede control. If we do, our relationship with machines can take three forms: we become peripheral and ignored, pets and patronized, or pests and exterminated. Enter Arnie.

"Movi.Kanti.Revo: Google And Cirque Du Soleil Launch A “Sensory Chrome Experiment”

At its I/O developer conference earlier this year, Google showed off an upcoming browser-based collaboration with Cirque du Soleil that was meant to bring some of Cirque’s imagination to the browser. This experiment, Movi.Kanti.Revo , is now available online and it’s quite a trip. The experience makes full use of HTML5 and other modern web technologies and uses your webcam (or accelerometer) to track your movements as you wander through the imaginary world. Here is Google’s explanation of the experience: As Google notes, the webcam-driven interface was “made possible using the getUserMedia feature of WebRTC, a technology supported by modern browsers that, with your permission, gives web pages access to your computer’s camera and microphone without installing any additional software.” Just like all other Chrome experiments, the Cirque du Soleil experience is based on HTML5 and also uses CSS with 3D transitions. If you are interested in the technical details, Google also just posted a case study that delves into how exactly Google, Cirque du Soleil, and the development partner Subatomic Systems created this experience. Unsurprisingly, Movi.Kanti.Revo works best in Chrome. It should also work fine in other browsers, though chances are you will have to use your mouse and not your webcam to navigate.

"Careerfoundry Wants To Be The Next General Assembly For Tech Skills

General Assembly was one of the first in the tech space to get that high quality brand name for technology education. But although the company – which won significant backing – has been building out online tools and resources, most of its business remains offline in the real world. Now a startup out of Berlin hopes to repeat GA’s success but using online-only tools, starting with a ‘minimum viable product’. CareerFoundry is creating a customizable training package for vocational tech skills which aims to train technical teams in new technologies, onboard new employees and accelerate startups. The twist is that all of the work is done online in a peer-to-peer environment. People are matched with a mentor online and interact online and via Google Hangouts. The mentors are often drawn from the companies which offer the products themselves. Their programs will include training for FrontEnd Development, Ruby on Rails, UX & UI Design and Digital Marketing. A CareerFoundry mentor instructs groups of between 2 and 5 students. In turn, this acts as a conduit for partners like Invision App , Jumpstarter and others. Founder and CEO Raffalea Rein said they got some early traction with employers who were putting their staff through a 3 month programs, but that it became “clear we needed a better solution for teams.” She says they’ve found this P2P method far more effective than other methods. Rein previously cut her startup teeth with Rocket Internet, while co-founder Martin Ramsin is a Nokia product expert. The company changed its name from doBranch last month after 6 months of testing and development with 250 students.

"Philippines Telco Rolls Up Six Messaging Apps — Including Facebook Messenger & Whatsapp — Into One Unlimited Access Data Bundle

The rise and rise of mobile messaging apps is being fuelled by a variety of factors (cost, convenience, the virality of the network effect, stickers… the list goes on). But in emerging economies an increasing number of carrier tie-ins are also helping WhatsApp and co. to continue ‘killing it’. Such tie-ins typically involve the carrier selling bundles of unlimited access to a messaging services for a set fee — such as this WhatsApp bundle offered by Airtel in Nigeria. In exchange for waiving data costs for the service, telcos get to attract more customers by piggybacking on the popularity of WhatsApp (et al), and drive a new messaging-related revenue stream to replace their declining SMS revenues. It’s a partnership that many carriers used to exclusively have with BlackBerry. But as BlackBerry’s popularity continues to decline, and alternative mobile messaging platforms have emerged and grown fat with users, there’s no sensible reason for carriers not to diversify these free messaging bundles and get into bed with even more players. And today Philippines carrier Globe Telecom is doing just that. The telco has announced it’s extending a previous bundle it began offering last July, of free access to Viber, to include five more messaging services: Facebook Messenger, Kakao Talk, WhatsApp, WeChat and Line. The Globe Prepaid GoUNLI30 offer will let customers pay 30 peso ($0.70) to buy one day’s free access to all six OTT (over-the-top) players, plus unlimited texts to all networks, and unlimited calls to other Globe/Touch Mobile users. OTT in this context is the term used to refer to third party messaging app services  vs carriers’ own SMS-based messaging services. All of the OTT services included in the Globe bundle have multiple millions of users apiece — Globe refers to them collectively as “major OTT players” — with Facebook Messenger the relative runt of the group, with around 60 million global downloads, vs kingpin WeChat’s 300 million registered users. (Active monthly usage is a more interesting metric for messaging apps, albeit not one they all report. For an idea of the top of the market, WeChat recently reported its MAU as 190 million.) What’s especially interesting here is that Globe claims it’s “practically unheard of” for a telco to partner with multiple OTT companies. Indeed, go back a few years and carriers were frequently attempting to block OTT services like Skype, rather than encourage usage. A lot has changed since 2009, however. The success of so many mobile messaging apps in building huge user-bases for one vs carriers’ collectively failure to create popular OTT messaging services of their own. And, from the carrier business point of view, ongoing declines in traditional voice and text revenues necessitating a new approach to data-centric business models. Messaging startups are increasingly looking like the missing piece of the puzzle in emerging markets. So it seems unlikely that the Globe partnership will remain a multiple OTT outlier for long — which is certainly good news for “major OTT players” who can expect to see their user-bases bolstered by such partnerships. It may also be helpful for local messaging startups in these markets, provided they are able to accrue enough users to get their service on carriers’ radars. Globe, which reported a total mobile subscriber base of 36.1 million at the end of the first half of this year, told TechCrunch it will be looking for more OTT players to partner with in future — based on what its users are asking for. In other words: if you can build it and make the users come, carriers might come knocking too.

"Tred Gets $1.7M To Be An Uber For Car Test Drives

 Tred, a startup that allows you to order auto test drives to your home, is announcing a $1.7 million raise of seed funding today, from Fraser McCombs Capital, former Chairman and CEO of General Motors Rick Wagoner , Maveron Capital, Chris Sacca’s Lowercase Capital , Founder’s Co-Op , Great Oaks Venture Capital and TechStar’s David Cohen. The startup aims to compete with showrooms and car manufacturers that already allow shoppers to test drive autos outside of the showroom at “ride and drive” events and likens itself to an Uber for test drives, “with a twist of Zappos.” While car manufacturers and dealerships are ultimately biased by brand and sales goals, Tred co-founders Grant Feek and John Wehr argue that Tred is impartial — allowing you to pick from a variety of makes, models and types of cars using its selection and scheduling interface. Tred employs a group of full time and part time delivery people/concierges who will then deliver the car, or multiple cars, of your choosing to your doorstep. “The car industry hasn’t always jived with third-party innovators,” Feek says. “Fortunately, our investor base is ensuring that Tred works as well for dealers and manufacturers as it does for shoppers. In fact, our automotive partners in the Pacific Northwest inform every aspect of our process.” Feek actually has a lot of familiarity with the car dealership and test drive space, having worked in one over summers during high school and college. “Many shoppers (particularly families with kids, car seats and strollers) dread the logistical strains of visiting dealerships, which are often located on the outskirts of metro areas,” he says. “Some of our early shoppers had been ‘in the market’ for months, but had yet to visit a single dealer – until they heard about us.” Other fun facts about Grant Feek: He has a Harvard MBA, we actually went to school together at USC before this, and he was actually buying a car himself at the time of this interview — and yes, used Tred to do so. The startup, which is experiencing an 83% sale conversion rate on existing customers, will be using the money to experiment with customer acquisition and demand in addition to developing its mobile app. “We have some indication that the unique nature of our offline+online experience is sticky, and that the test drive presents an exciting content opportunity, but we still have a lot to test (around customer acquisition). The company, which monetizes by taking a cut of a car’s price if there’s a sale, plans on launching in Seattle in the spring. “We’re laser-focused on delighting families shopping for new cars in Seattle,” says Feek. “We had been planning to mass-produce electric vehicles and commercialize space flight, but someone beat us to it.”

"Professor Layton And The Unwound Characterization

    Warning: This article contains spoilers from Professor Layton and the Unwound Future. Do not read on if you don't want the game's story spoiled.  Professor Layton became known more for its many puzzles than its gripping narrative, but the fact remains that the games have always put a great deal of effort into quality stories and characters complete with full voice acting and animated cutscenes. Unfortunately, they’re seen as superfluous by many since they have nothing to do with the puzzles themselves, which are the reason people play the games. And the recurring characters, charming as they are, become one-note archetypes when put under a microscope. But the third game in the seires, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, leverages these perceived weaknesses to create perhaps one of the most moving game stories of the year.   The Layton games always end with some preposterous explanation for why the game world is a lie, but that usually just sets the stage for some bittersweet personal tragedy. Unwound Future is no different. You find out that the London of the future you’re running around in is actually an elaborate stage built in a vast underground cavern set up by one of the antagonists to fool Layton, among others, into thinking they were stranded in time. This also sets things up for another tragedy, but this time the tragedy is Layton’s. The entire point of the charade was to trick a group of scientists into creating a working time machine so that Dimitri, the antagonist you pursue through most of the game, can go back and stop a lab accident that killed the woman he loved, Claire, who also happened to be Layton’s love.  The game provides a bittersweet moment that rivals the other games with the final antagonist Clive. Posing as the future version of Luke, he manipulated both Layton and Dimitri with the sole purpose of destroying London to get revenge on the prime minister, who was responsible for the lab explosion that killed his parents. As Clive is being taken away by the police after his plan is thwarted, we are treated to a flashback of young Clive being restrained and comforted by none other than Professor Layton. It’s a poignant moment that tugs at the heartstrings slightly, especially given what Clive just tried to do and fits with the rest of the series’ melancholy endings.  But this is not where the story ends. It is then revealed that Celeste, the woman who appears to aid Layton in the final hours of the investigation and claims to be Claire’s sister is actually Claire herself, who was sent ten years into the future thanks to the lab accident. She was unstable, however, and could be sent back at any moment to face the resulting explosion and her death. The moment Layton learns all of this is mere minutes before this happens, meaning that Layton is forced to say goodbye to the woman he loves once more. Watching him come to terms with this is utterly gut-wrenching, especially if you’re a longtime Layton fan. This scene alone results in a giant emotional payoff for the player, but only because previous games laid the groundwork.   The story itself is not what makes this scene moving. After all, when taken out of context, it is very similar to Diabolical Box’s end, what with the themes of coming to terms with lost love. It is the fact that Professor Layton is the one who must do so here. Up until this point, Layton has been a fairly static character that served as merely a witness to tragic events through deduction. After two games of an unchanging Layton, the player is conditioned with a solid definition of who the Professor is: mostly stoic, occasionally cheerful, and always proper. The third game leverages the player’s preconceptions by making the story about him and his past. You begin to see why he is the way he is through several flashbacks of his time with Claire. We see his trademark gentleman’s mantra develop as he is preparing to accept a job at a university. Claire begins to refer to him as a true gentleman, even giving him his trademark top hat as a present. Through it all, Layton remains stoic, awkward even. It is completely characteristic of the character, and though he doesn’t change, we have a better understanding of why he is the way he is.  The moment where Claire is saying goodbye before warping to her death is where Layton’s unchanging characterization begins to shatter. He breaks down and begins to show real emotion, something he has never done in the previous games. He begins to cry and yells for Claire not to go, a scene amplified by his simple character design. After all, his face is just two dots for eyes and a line for a mouth, perfectly complimenting his stoic nature. Here, the expression in his eyes change for the first time in the series to a look of utter sadness and anguish, complete with tears streaming. The reason this is so striking is because it breaks from his established character. Normally this wouldn’t be a big deal, but fans have been conditioned to think of him as static and unchanging over multiple games. The sight of Layton losing it is jarring for players because it defies this conditioning, opening the flood gates for an emotional reaction. Any attachment or fondness for the character previous to this only compounds the feeling. You are suffering right along with him.   Professor Layton is not the only character who ceases to be static, however. Luke is also forced to face reality and reacts in a way we haven’t seen. The static Luke we are conditioned into knowing is clearly still a child, but behaves in every way like the apprentice he tells everyone he is. He models his life after the professor in every way, striving to become a gentleman at every turn. He goes with him everyone and has since the beginning of the series, leading the player to think that it always was that way in the same fashion that Back to the Future expected you to just accept the friendship between Marty and Doc Brown. But Unwound Future shakes up this vision: Luke’s parents are still a factor, as they are moving with Luke in tow. Suddenly, the relationship that we’re expected to blindly go along with is forever changed. Video game logic disappears for a moment and real life rules appear. As Luke is leaving for his new home and Layton tries to comfort him by telling him that gentlemen don’t make a scene in public. However, Luke says that it’s a good thing he’s not a gentleman yet and begins to cry even more, hugging Layton as they say their goodbyes. The boy who would do anything for the approval of his hero can’t contain himself anymore and shows his weakness. But Layton just got done with an emotional experience of his own, so he’s better equipped to respond accordingly. Or maybe we’re more ready to believe it after seeing Layton himself break down. Either way, it’s just one more moving moment in a game full of them.  Whether it be through attachment or conditioning, Unwound Future pulled no punches when constructing its story, an impressive feat for a game where most think it doesn’t matter. More impressive still is the game’s utilization of its own history and structure to advance its own storytelling methods, something that more series shouldn’t be afraid to do. Smart manipulation of characterization perception has lead a series with heart to a game that is unafraid to move the player’s heart. And with Professor Layton and the Specter’s Flute going back to explore how the Professor and Luke met, it stands that the series narrative will only continue to grow and develop.

"Chinese Travel Booking Giant Ctrip Invests $180M In India’S Makemytrip

Ctrip , the Chinese travel booking site valued at over $10 billion, has taken a big step in India after it agreed to invest $180 million in MakeMyTrip , a fellow booking service that covers flights, hotels and bus ticketing in the South Asian country. The investment is in convertible bonds but MakeMyTrip, a 15-year-old company that is listed on the Nasdaq, will allow Ctrip to own up to 26.6 percent of its existing shareholding. Ctrip will also get a seat on the MakeMyTrip board. News of the investment sent the Indian company’s share price soaring — it rose by 23.5 percent at the close of trading on Thursday to give MakeMyTrip a market cap of $689.4 million. Statements from both companies indicated that they will work closely together going forward. “We believe there are many similarities in the Indian and Chinese online travel markets and we expect this strategic relationship between two market leaders to be mutually beneficial,” commented Deep Kalra, founder and group CEO at MakeMyTrip. Ctrip closed out the year with a partnership with long-term rival Qunar , which is controlled by majority shareholder Baidu, in October. The deal, which wasn’t one of the many consolidation mergers that happened in China in 2015, gave Ctrip a 45 percent voting interest in Qunar in exchange for Internet giant Baidu taking 25 percent of Ctrip. Together, Ctrip and Qunar are estimated to account for 70-80 percent — iResearch claims Qunar leads flight bookings with 32 percent marketshare, while Ctrip is winning on hotel bookings with 39 percent marketshare — so, with a dominance in China secured thanks to their alliance, Ctrip’s foray into India makes sense. India is increasingly an attractive market for Chinese tech companies. Economic uncertainties at home coupled with the slowing growth of smartphone sales run in stark contrast to India, where the economy is growing fast and accelerating smartphone sales have the potential to bring hundreds of millions of the population online for the first time. That’s caused Chinese tech firms — in both the hardware and software spaces — to move into India over the past year or so. Phone-maker Xiaomi is perhaps the most visible example , but China’s top internet firms BAT — an acronym that covers Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent — have done so, too, illustrating that the industry in general is casting glances westwards towards India and its billion-plus population. Tencent made a major India-based investment last year — backing medical booking startup Practo by leading its $90 million Series C round — while Alibaba increased its holding in mobile payments and e-commerce company Paytm, which was valued at over $1 billion from an earlier injection of capital from Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial . Baidu, is yet to make an investment, but the company has reportedly been scouting India for potential opportunities. Now we can add Ctrip to that list. “Today’s announcement marks the beginning of the strategic relationship between Ctrip and MakeMyTrip. Through this transaction, Ctrip has now gained exposure to India’s fast growing online travel market,” James Liang, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Ctrip, said in a statement.

"Lobster Adds Verizon Cloud To Its Ai-Powered Photo Licensing Arsenal

Lobster, a Startup Battlefield company from 2014 , is breathing new life into its AI-powered media licensing platform by partnering with Verizon Cloud. Advertisers, publications, agencies and the media will now have the means to license images sourced from social media and now, Verizon Cloud. For every image sold, 75% of the profit goes towards the contributor, ranging in skill from pro photographer to regular Instagrammer. For regular users (you!), this means is that if you sign-up for Lobster and upload images to the service from your Verizon Cloud, you can proceed to license and sell them for profit. Lobster’s artificial intelligence engine kicks in by analyzing these images, building a neural network and enabling detailed search methods, thus enabling the discovery of your work. It’s worth noting that image licensing fees are meant to affordable, so Lobster isn’t cut out to be a primary source of income, but instead a plausible way of making money while also protecting the copyright integrity of things you publish on social media. In practice, brands and advertisers contact regular social media users to license their content for advertisements or other creative materials, either via email or social media comment. From there, users can log-into a dashboard that allows them to manage their licensed images, accept offers and purchase images in turn. Thus far, the company has integrated with many recognizable companies that manage large stores of media: Google Photos, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, VK and more recently, Dropbox . By accessing the billions of images on the Verizon Cloud, produced by millions of users, the Lobster AI’s search and auto-tagging capabilities will improve, until Lobster adds another social media source to its catalog.

"Nokia Ace (Lumia 900) Specs Trickle Out

Until now the 4G LTE-capable Nokia Ace (or Lumia 900, if you prefer) has been largely a mystery. We got a peek at some leaked press shots last week (pictured), but all we’ve heard is that it’ll hit AT&T shelves on March 18, it’ll be powered by the Windows Phone platform, and that it’ll come equipped with an LTE radio. Today, however, PocketNow claims to have confirmed the specs on this bad boy. If true, we’re looking at a 4.3-inch WVGA display (a tad larger than what we’ve seen so far out of the Lumia line), an 8-megapixel camera, a front-facing camera, and 512MB of RAM. The phone features T-Mo’s 1700MHz band, so there should be a way to hop onto the pink network shortly after the phone’s release. According to PocketNow, the Lumia 900 weighs in at 160 grams with a waist line of about 12mm. The source also confirms that this particular handset will run Windows Phone 7.5 Mango, rather than the incremental Tango update. All in all, this looks like a solid flagship from Microsoft and Nokia, and we expect to see the official announcement cross the wires at CES or Mobile World Congress. Stay tuned.

"Palantir Raises $50 Million Of Reported $400 Million Round

Palantir , the big data company that’s one of the Valley’s most valuable, having secured clients like the NSA, FBI and CIA early on before building up its private-sector customer base, has raised another $50 million, according to a new SEC filing . The round is still ongoing, however, and may total $400 million when complete. In early November, a Palantir filing emerged that indicated it would be paying around $10 million in sales commissions, which led Dan Primack at Fortune to estimate that Palantir could raise between $222 million and $500 million , based on standard commissions and those previously paid. However, new documents unearthed by VC Experts , which were filed in late November, show Palantir authorizing $400 million of a new series of preferred stock. We asked VC Experts if the new Form D, which indicates the company has now raised $50 million, is likely part of this larger $400 million round, and they believe it is. If the round completes, that will bring Palantir’s total raise to around $1.35 billion, according to data from CrunchBase which says the company has raised $950 million to date. (VC Experts doesn’t have the funding that high, we should note, but says there are a lot of outliers.) Last December, Palantir was raising funding at what was then considered a hefty $9 billion valuation , and finally closed that round in September at $444.2 million, says CrunchBase. Over the summer, Palantir spent some of its money on two acquisitions in a single week – one was for social polling and analytics startup Poptip , which was soon followed by Propeller , a startup offering tools for building native mobile apps. The news was especially interesting because the data analysis company had only ever made one other acquisition (at least, publicly) when it bought email startup and Y Combinator alum VoiceGem in early 2013. It’s unclear what Palantir’s valuation will be if it closes on the $400 million because there are still too many outliers, VC Experts tells us. But they say the new round is priced higher than the previous one. A number of Silicon Valley companies have raised at high valuations recently. For example, transportation and ride-sharing startup Uber announced this month it raised $1.2 billion in new funding, in a round that sees the company valued at a record $40 billion – or four times more other Silicon Valley startups like Airbnb, valued at $10 billion , or Dropbox .

"Facebook And Itunes To Treat Students Like Children

College oriented social network Facebook announced a Back to School partnership with iTunes today that could have been an interesting teachable moment about buying music online through legal means.  Instead the deal will offer millions of “samplers,” preselected playlists of 25 songs per genre, given to Facebook users for free.  What’s the lesson here?  That the iTunes music store is a highly controlled environment that provides an inferior user experience compared to P2P networks.  Twenty five free songs of your choice would have made a much cooler promotion.  Even that would have been pretty unimaginative. Here’s a link to launch the Alternative sampler in the iTunes music store. Ten million “samplers” will be given away over the next ten weeks, so that’s the equivalent of $247,500,000 worth of downloads at full price.  But of course music downloads are in reality almost free, so they aren’t spending much money on it. Facebook and iTunes have had a long running relationship prior to this promotion and few new customers are likely to be introduced to the iTunes Music Store for the first time as a result of it.  The theory may be that students will discover new bands through the promotion and will then buy more songs from those artists.  It seems more likely to me that a large number of those students will take their free songs from iTunes and then download entire albums via the P2P networks they learn about from their school mates. The problem is that “free and legal” is not a sufficient value add when it comes to a youth demographic. Imagine if the promotion did something like this instead:  instead of an anonymously compiled mix tape of random songs, each week Facebook users could download for free 25 songs compiled by a notable expert in that week’s genre.  Perhaps that expert could even do a live streaming conversation midweek talking about why they chose the songs they did and answering listener questions moderated by an interviewer.  Now that would be interesting.  I’m sure there are a world of possibilities here and the promotion as it stands just seems lazy and boring. Facebook has a huge userbase – 8.3 million users, the company says, with half logging in daily.  I talked to an online video service exec last week who told me that the MPAA people know that everyone laughs at their anti-piracy messages at the movies.  Apparently the same can’t be said about the big boys in the music world.  What a lost opportunity.  I’m all for online music services making money, but they are going to have to come up with something other than scarcity as their business model and patronizing moves like this are just stupid.  Even cola company promotions at the convenience store let you choose what to spend your free downloads on, how much less cool could a partnership get than this?

"Windows 10 Testers Can Now Buy And Rent Movies And Tv Shows In The Windows Store, Music To Be Added Next

 Microsoft today announced the Windows Store is getting music, movies, and TV shows in addition to apps and games. Movies and TV shows are rolling out to the new Windows Store for Windows Insiders (Windows 10 testers) “over the course of the next 24 hours” and music will be following “in the coming weeks.” This is Microsoft’s answer to Google Play and iTunes.  The rollout comes just over a week after Microsoft revealed Windows 10’s new Music and Video apps in preview, which integrate directly with the Windows Store. These apps notably dropped the Xbox branding of their predecessors, which frankly never made sense in the first place.   Last month, Microsoft added “Movies & TV” to the Windows Store beta, but the category didn’t have any content. Now, Windows Insiders in the following countries will be able to purchase and/or rent movies and TV shows: Australia, Austria, Belgium (only movies — no TV content), Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S.  Those who have accumulated a digital collection in Xbox Video will see it show up in the new Video Preview app. Your movies and TV shows will be accessible on all your Windows devices and your Xbox One, Microsoft promises.  In addition to missing some movie and TV show details, the Video app still has one big limitation today: You can only stream the videos you buy or rent. The good news is that the ability to download content to watch offline is on its way.  This is clearly Microsoft’s attempt at competing with Google Play and Apple’s iTunes. By bundling its new Windows Store into the world’s most popular desktop operating system, Microsoft has a small advantage, but its mobile failures and the sheer lateness of this push will make it an incredibly difficult uphill battle.

"Watch 8 Flying Drones Jam On Keyboards, Drums, And Guitar

 File this under “pointlessly awesome:” a couple of roboticists have created a band out of flying drones.  The eight drones hover over their musical instruments — keyboards, drums, a one-string guitar, and even a bank of bells — and play the notes by swooping and diving at precisely the right moments.  KMel Robotics created the demonstration to show off the capabilities of its six-rotor drones.   The company’s two founding engineers, Alex Kushleyev and Daniel Mellinger, spent two years programming the drones to pull off this stunt.  “Music is really just playing a series of notes at the right times,” said Mellinger, demonstrating that he is both an amazingly capable engineer and also that he is totally missing the point about what music really is.  Still, with the ability to communicate with the drones and adjust their positions 100 times per second, the team is able to make the drones swoop and strike the instruments with amazing precision and speed.  The robot band plays their two drum kits, four keyboards, 20 bells, and a gong simply by dropping into position and striking the instruments at the right moments. A one-string guitar is played by two drones: One to fret the string, and the other to pluck it.  A couple of years ago, the team programmed drones to play the James Bond theme song using a less-sophisticated setup, and got over 3.6 million views. The new band is faster, plays music more naturally, and has a repertoire of three songs instead of just one.  The company published its latest robot music video to YouTube last week.

"Deezer Launches Offline Browser Mode To Catch Up With Spotify

Deezer came out well before Spotify appeared on the horizon – 2007 in fact – to disrupt the streaming music space, but it faces a problem. Spotify has sucked up a lot of air despite having less registered users, 15 million to Deezer’s 20 million. The again Deezer has 1.5 million paying subscribers when Spotify is over 3 million right now. What do they do next? Deezer is fighting back, doubling down outside of the U.S. aiming to launch in 200 territories this year (most recently the U.K.), although not in the U.S., where Spotify just launched. Still, the Paris-based company today iterates on its product with the launch of an off-line mode which will run inside the browser. It is currently available on Chrome, and will be on other browsers very soon. Yes folks, that means you won’t need a desktop app, unlike Spotify. The announcement was made today at the London Web Summit by CEO Axel Dauchez. The “off-line mode” allows Deezer Premium+ subscribers to download their music library to their computers and to access it offline This could be an advantage. It’s an open standard so it will be easier for Deezer to integrate social media features (Facebook, Twitter, Last.fm…) and faster to iterate than a desktop app. It will be interesting to see if this aids Deezer’s mission to be the music streaming service of choice for Rest Of World.

"The World Isn’T Ready For Google’S Instant Apps

 If you’ve been following the tech industry news lately, you might have heard about this new, unlaunched feature that Google presented at I/O this year: Android Instant Apps . According to the limited information released, users will be able to run subsections of a full native app on their phone without having to visit the Play Store once it’s live. Simply put, you click a link and you’re running the native app on your phone. There’s no Play Store page. There’s no “Install” button. There’s no waiting. Just an instant native app experience on Android.  Android only? It would be naive to assume that Apple isn’t working on a similar technology. In iOS 9, Apple launched the preface to the iOS version of Instant Apps: app thinning , where only a fraction of the native app is downloaded before it’s ready for use. The remainder of the app is then downloaded as you use it.  I’ve spent the last few years dreaming of days when apps would be instantly accessible from the click of a deep link, taking users from mobile web straight to the correct content in the app. The Play and App Store are the last remaining blockades on the road to building successful, mobile-only businesses. There has never been a more exciting time to be in mobile.  However, before we all start betting the farm on Instant Apps and the Apple equivalent, let’s take a pragmatic look at the potential impact of this technology. Ultimately, the impact will only be as significant as the number of companies that adopt the technology, which will determine how much of an impact it will have on the mobile user experience. Based on our understanding of the landscape, at the current maturity level in the mobile ecosystem, it could be incredibly difficult for companies to incorporate Instant Apps into their product.  Enterprise organizations can’t support Instant Apps  Up until this point, the native app represented a siloed treat for a brand’s most loyal users. It’s a must-have checkbox for all significant consumer brands, and executives at these companies will proudly flaunt their native app, boasting of their trendiness. However, what I’ve found out after engaging with many of them, is that the team responsible for the native app is often fragmented from the rest of the company. This leads to a disconnected product strategy and overall lower quality experiences in mobile. The app is just not a priority for large enterprises.  Why, you might ask? The reason is that the ratio of users in the native app is still relatively low compared to the amount of foot traffic in the store or web traffic on the site. The users of these apps are mostly tech-savvy power users, which on paper seems relatively insignificant to other channels. Instant Apps promises that this balance of traffic will be dramatically changed, driving a majority of mobile users to the native app instead of the mobile web. It means their native experience is about to get a firehose of new users.  With this additional traffic comes the additional burden to ensure the native app is up to date with the rest of the site and bug free. To address this problem, the team responsible for the native app will need to be better integrated into the organization and likely better staffed. Large, traditional companies will first have to make the decision that it’s meaningful to their business to support the new technology; then they’ll need to spend a year or more reorganizing. Just think about how long it took most companies to build mobile-friendly websites.  Marketing services can’t support Instant Apps  Marketing teams of large enterprises have typically struggled to incorporate their native app into their day-to-day activities. When you’ve spent the last 15 years sending millions of emails a day promoting your website, it’s difficult to include an existing native app in these campaigns, let alone Instant Apps. Meanwhile, 66 percent of emails are opened from mobile devices.  The problem for these marketers is that in an app-based world, browser cookies are useless. Cookies are the foundation for user identities on the web, helping to ensure user experience consistency and supporting for robust reporting on user activities. Cookies don’t exist within apps, which has already significantly splintered the user identity. However, it hasn’t been a significant issue to date, as app users only represent a small portion of a business’s total user base. Additionally, mobile marketing services have popped up looking to address the needs of the marketer responsible for the native app.  But what happens when most mobile traffic suddenly disappears from cookie-based analytics systems? Or you can’t retarget audiences based on a tracking pixel? Or mobile clicks don’t register in your email service provider dashboard? If mobile, which represents a majority of digital traffic for these businesses, suddenly doesn’t show up in their tools, it’s catastrophic. While working with client companies, I’ve seen the decision to prioritize analytics and reporting over a better user experience made again and again. It’s a show stopper and will prevent companies from adopting Instant Apps.  Lack of web-native parity will block Instant Apps  As an organization scales, the primary reason that the pace of growth slows is the need for consistent communication on key strategies. You want to ensure that the messaging coming out of one group is consistent with the messaging of another. It adds significant overhead to maintain this consistency. This same consistency of messaging is needed across different product platforms. When a campaign is launched, you want to ensure that this campaign is evident everywhere consumers experience your brand.  Now imagine a futuristic world where you have to maintain a mobile website, an Instant App, and a full Android app. Campaign messaging would need to be designed to show in all formats and implemented in each. A marketing manager will need to pester the product managers for each platform to ensure consistency. It’ll be a logistical nightmare.  With the onset of Instant Apps, links that point to a business’s property must now assume parity across the website, Instant App, and native app. But I know from experience that links rarely work across both the web and the app. This introduces an entirely new platform that must support linking and provide functional parity. It will require substantial effort from the product team to ensure this parity across the three different potential user experiences on the Android platform alone, let alone iOS and Apple’s upcoming response.  Silicon Valley skepticism  All in all, the promise of the Instant Apps platform sounds like a spectacular innovation that can drive significant additional revenue and conversion for businesses. But there are substantial issues that could slow companies in adopting it.  Still, it’ll be exciting to see how it plays out. We’ll be watching from the sidelines for a while to see what sticks.

"Miggo Camera Strap Protects Your Gear, Too, So You Don’T Need A Bulky Camera Bag

 A new Kickstarter project takes a useful thing and makes it even more useful, by offering a strap that not only carries your DSLR but also protects it when not in use. It’s the perfect way to minimize your equipment when you’re out shooting on a trip and don’t need your full camera bag and gear, and it’s so deceptively simple, it’s a wonder it doesn’t already exist. The Miggo strap is designed by Israel-based industrial designer Ohad Cohen, who was a founder of professional camera bag maker Kata, which remains one of the leading makers of bags for pros and hobbyists. Cohen was the first product designer at Kata, then later was in charge of R&D, so he knows a thing or two about creating camera gear. Miggo is designed around the philosophy that while there’s plenty of interest in photography since the advent of smartphones, people avoid high-quality cameras and gear because of the convenience factor of using their mobile devices. To alleviate that, the Miggo combines a sling strap to secure your camera with a wrap that protects it when not in use. It also comes in a grip variety for those who prefer tying their camera to their wrist to prevent drops. Both versions quickly tie around both camera lens and body to provide a secure protective layer, which then allows you to chuck the camera into a shoulder bag or backpack along with all your other stuff, instead of having to use a segmented, padded camera bag designed specifically for protecting gear. It has a tripod mount adapter built-in so you don’t have to remove it to take time-lapse or other stabilized shots, and there are versions for both standard DSLRs and smaller-bodies compact mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras, like Sony’s NEX series. Early backers can pre-order for $30 while supplies last, at which time it goes up to $35 for the Grip + Wrap or $40 for the Strap + Wrap. I’m so tired of lugging my 70-lb. bag of camera gear around airports that this seems like a very appealing option when I don’t feel like I’ll need my entire kit. The company anticipates shipping the Miggo by June of this year, and development has progressed to the point where prototypes are essentially ready to ship (once a proper production line is established). Miggo hits the sweet spot between affordability, convenience and smart design, so it’s very likely they’ll reach their modest $20,000 goal quickly.

"Book Review: “Tell To Win,” By Peter Guber

 (Editor’s note: Lou Hoffman is CEO of The Hoffman Agency. He submitted this story to VentureBeat.)  Peter Guber has enjoyed an eclectic career, learning a thing or two about new ventures along the way.  After heading Columbia Pictures (now Sony Pictures Entertainment), he launched Mandalay Entertainment, the name behind (among other films) “Seven Years in Tibet.” More recently, another set of business challenges has surfaced as he and partner Joe Lacob try to remake the Golden State Warriors, no easy task for the team that traded Robert Parish for Joe Barry Carroll and selected Chris Washburn with the third pick in the 1986 draft (but I’m not bitter).  Here’s the punch line: Whether navigating the waters between Hollywood and his Sony bosses in Tokyo or trying to convince Fidel Castro to allow his crew to film in Havana Bay, Guber always had a secret weapon at his side: the ability to tell a story.  In “Tell To Win” (due out March 1), Guber articulates how storytelling can become part of any executive’s leadership arsenal, by channeling his own experiences as well as the knowledge of colleagues.  Among the tales:   We learn how then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton      used the movie “High Noon” as the stage setter to tin cup for $90K to keep      his campaign alive after losing the New Hampshire primary.  We learn Famous Amos liked the cookie business better      than the agent business.  We learn Guber went on the movie set to tell Dean      Martin to shape up only to have Frank Sinatra intervene with a “Who the      hell are you?” before physically pushing him out the door.   Guber focuses on oral storytelling, a key point in the book. If you need to win someone over to your way of thinking, don’t get on the phone or send an e-mail or draft a 140-character plea on Twitter. Get face-to-face with the person.  With this as the backdrop, I found three takeaways that frame the book.  First, recognize that emotions play just as an important role as intellect in how people make decisions. Stories – not facts, figures and spreadsheets – tap the heart. This concept can be difficult to grasp for those coming from technical orientations. Engineers in particular tend to view anecdotes as fluff, not fodder, for bolstering one’s communications.  The book also explains the importance of personalizing your story with a hero.  There’s simplicity in the definition of a hero that comes from basketball coach and executive Pat Riley: “In every story there’s one person who can make the difference. That’s your hero.”  And finally, storytelling offers a means to show vulnerability, a quality for building trust. According to Keith Ferrazzi, author of “Never Eat Alone” and one of Guber’s resources: “Vulnerability is one of the most underappreciated assets in business today. Everyone has something in common with every other person. And you don’t find those similarities if you don’t open up and expose your interests and concerns, allowing others to do likewise.”  Putting the double negative aside, it’s an excellent point.  For those who favor their geek side, Guber also tackles the cognitive part of storytelling. I especially liked the thoughts of Jerome Bruner, a cognitive psychologist, who said “Narrative emerges from violations to expectations.”  And neuroscientist Dan Siegel explains that “You have expectations in your head; I have expectations in my head. We sit down to breakfast. I tell you, ‘I got up this morning, I went to the bathroom and picked up my toothbrush and put toothpaste on it, blah, blah, blah.’ Our expectations are totally in sync. There’s no violation of them. It’s boring. It’s not memorable.”  Allow me to simplify the equation: Violation = Attention.  It’s not a perfect book, though. I could have done without some of the pop psychology lessons, but these aren’t major flaws. The entertainment value in “Tell To Win” allows the storytelling medicine to go down nice and easy – and for those who like their lessons bulletized, every chapter ends with “aHHa!” moments.  If you’re looking to explore and apply the persuasive qualities of storytelling, “Tell To Win” makes for a good starting point.

"Nigerian Fintech Company Interswitch Could Become Africa’S First Public Startup Unicorn

 Africa’s first billion-dollar tech IPO on a major exchange may be imminent. Nigerian digital payments company Interswitch will likely go public on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 2016, sources confirm. The Lagos based fintech firm, majority owned by private equity group Helios Investment Partners , provides much of Nigeria’s digital finance infrastructure. Founded in 2002, Interswitch’s product platforms process the bulk of the country’s growing volume in electronic bank, government, and corporate financial transactions. In personal finance, 32 million consumers use the company’s Verve chip and PIN cards, while its Quickteller digital payment app processed $2.4 billion in transactions. On a pending IPO, Interswitch CEO and founder Mitchell Elegbe confirmed, “a dual-listing on the London and Lagos stock exchange is an option on the table. But “It’s not the only one,” he explained, “to facilitate potential exits” by the company’s private equity investors. “We are also looking at a possible trade sale ,” Elegbe said on a telephone call from Lagos. Though Interswitch’s CEO would not confirm a 2016 IPO, two sources said the company’s listing is imminent. “They’ve already selected the ibankers and will likely go public sometime between Q2 to Q4 at (or close to) a $1 billion dollar valuation–roughly two times revenues,” said Eghosa Omoigui, Managing Partner of EchoVC , a Silicon Valley fund investing in African startups. “This is similar to what I’ve heard,” said a another Nigerian startup head who asked not to be named, but whose company is also backed by one of Interswitch’s investors. “Look for them to launch on the LSE in 2016, just north of $1 billion,” the source confirmed. Any billion dollar liquidity event, whether an IPO or trade sale, would mark a milestone for African tech, which to date has produced only a handful of exits and no major public listing. Across the continent, a burgeoning IT sector is emerging parallel to growth and reform in core economies. In countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana, broadband capacity is improving, smartphone penetration is rising, and many business sectors are formalizing. Added to this are the demographics of a youth driven consumer market expected to spend over $1 trillion annually by 2020. This equation creates strong tech opportunities for ventures focused on digital commerce and payments. Some VC investors have taken note, supporting African consumer goods, digital content , and fintech oriented startups to the tune of $400 million in 2014, according to Crunchbase supported research. Interswitch investors Helios Partners and Adlevo Capital also back ventures such as ecommerce platform MallforAfrica and Nigerian payments firm Paga . When it comes to digital finance in Africa, discussions usually lead to Kenya’s M-PESA product, run by telco Safaricom. The mobile money platform, recently profiled by “ 60 Minutes ,” is now used by 13 million customers, transfers $12  billion in P2P payments annually, and generated 20 percent of Safaricom’s 2014 $1.5 billion revenues. But M-PESA has not found similar success elsewhere in Africa and is facing stiffer competition from banks, telcos, and other fintech firms (including Visa and Mastercard) eager to challenge its Kenyan dominance and scale new apps to Africa’s digital finance market. Many point to Nigeria as the continent’s greatest revenue opportunity for electronic payments given its dual status as Africa’s most populous nation  (175 million) and largest economy ($510 billion). Consumers in the West African country spend $400 million annually and are projected to generate $75 billion in ecommerce revenue by 2020. Nigeria’s P2P digital payments traffic compared to Kenya, however, has been slower to scale–largely due to entrenched consumer preferences for cash and a more cumbersome fintech regulatory environment. A 2014 Gates Foundation study estimated Nigeria’s e-payments revenue potential at $1.2 billion if it attained Kenya’s volumes. Interswitch continues to build digital finance market share in Nigeria and broader Africa. It operates in five African countries and recently launched its Verve payments product on Safaricom’s home turf after acquiring Kenya’s Paynet. Interswitch CEO Elegbe said a possible IPO would also support the company’s plans to expand into additional African countries. As for Interswitch possibly becoming Africa’s first tech unicorn, “It’s obviously good for the market to demonstrate African tech companies can generate that level of revenue,” said EchoVC’s Omoigui. “On the question of exits and IPOS, we’ve gone from ‘if’ to ‘when’ to potentially ‘who next?’. Minting our first fintech unicorn will make a lot of VC investors take African tech much more seriously.”

"Zoho Adds Workspaces, Access Controls, Widgets And More To Zoho Wiki

Zohi Wiki , which originally launched in 2006 , is getting an upgrade today, with additional collaboration features, access controls and more. Zoho has added workspaces within Wiki to allow teams to have their own groups within organization wikis. Each workspace has its own administrative and customization options and can serve as a separate portal. Zoho has also added more in-depth access controls to wikis, which allows administrators to set permissions for Workspaces, multiple groups, individuals, domains, public, and for users within an organization. Admins can also assign separate permissions for edit, view, create and delete functions. Zoho Wikis can now be personalized with widgets to create custom dashboards. Widgets aggregate content from YouTube, Google, Box.net as well as other Zoho apps like Zoho Calendar, Zoho Creator and Zoho Chat. Additionally, Zoho is now allowing organizations to customize their wikis with logos, images, layout and more.  And the startup has turned on notifications on all the changes happening in a company’s Wiki or Workspace or a particular page. Zoho continues to improve upon its offerings, and just launched unified search across all of its properties. This allows a user to do a keyword search across an organization’s entire suite, across multiple applications including email, documents, forums, contacts, and more. Zoho now reaches over 2 million users and is even catching the attention of its competition. And not only is the company profitable, but Zoho has never taken venture capital investment. Zoho Wiki faces competition from PBworks and others. A few months ago, Zoho launched an application with the rollout of the Google App Marketplace and integrated Facebook Connect.

"Cisco Gets Into The Social Network Business With Quad

 Does the world really need another business social network? Apparently Cisco thinks so, because it plans to release one later this year. The company has been revealing more details of the new product, called Quad, in advance of a demonstration Tuesday at the Enterprise 2.0 conference in Boston.  As described by Murali Sitaram, vice president and general manager of the company’s enterprise collaboration platform group, Quad takes advantage of Cisco’s existing strength in voice and video communication. He said it seems like a “natural transition or next step to get into the new collaboration world with content, documents, communication, and social coming together on this platform.”  Quad will be the first social network combining “asynchronous” communication, like status updates and microblogging, with more direct, immediate communication through tools like live video, Sitaram said. For example, if you find someone available in the network with knowledge that’s useful for your project, you can start a video chat or a web conference with them right away, rather than sending a message and waiting for a response. (For similar reasons, collaboration startup PBworks recently added voice capabilities .)  Other features include the ability to create personalized home pages, search all the content in your company, and integrate with other document systems like Microsoft SharePoint and Documentem. Quad will also include Cisco Show and Share, a video editing and sharing program that the company announced last year . And users will be able to access Quad when they’re away from their desk through downloadable applications for iPad and iPhone.  Cisco isn’t sharing pricing details yet, but Sitaram said Quad will be available this fall. It already offers tools for building customer social networks through a service called Cisco Eos .  The company is also announcing a couple of other business products. One of its recent hits has been its easy-to-use Flip video camera, which Cisco’s Prosumer General Manager Paul Fulton said has been embraced by companies as well as consumers. To serve those business users, Cisco has created a new service called FocalPoint, where companies can store all the video footage taken by their Flip cameras and other devices. Another new product, the latest version of WebEx Connect IM, a chat application using technology acquired from Jabber , is now accessible in Web browsers and doesn’t require a download. Cisco is also releasing a library of related code that allows customers to add presence and chat capabilities to their own applications.

"Maemo 5 Screenshot Leaks, We Gush

Way back in May, we got our hands on the world’s first concept image of Maemo Harmattan , a distant (as in late 2010) version of the operating system Nokia tucks onto their internet tablet devices. Maemo Harmattan is otherwise known as Maemo 6, with the latest publicly available release being Maemo 4.1. That leaves one whole big bad version of Maemo out of the picture. Well, here it is – at least, a very small, tantalizing chunk of it. Eldar Murtazin, a Russian blogger with an uncanny knack for all things Nokia, posted this picture on his blog earlier today, giving us the tiniest of peeks at what Nokia’s got in store for version 5. It doesn’t reveal a thing, outside of the fact that the Maemo team’s UI/Visual team is a talented bunch – but it sure does make us want more. [ Engadget via BGR ]

"Pokémon Go Reclaims Top-Grossing Spot On Iphone

 Pikachu needed a quick rest at a PokéCenter, and now he’s already returned to dominating his mobile gaming competition.  Pokémon Go is once again the top-grossing iPhone game in the United States, according to data from Sensor Tower and App Annie . The Google Maps-powered augmented reality experience has players tracking down digital monsters along the streets and walking paths in the real world. After debuting in July, the game immediately destroyed records for the fastest app to 500 million installs and $500 million dollars . After falling to as low as No. 4 on the highest-grossing iPhone games in the U.S. on September 29, Pokémon Go has climbed back over head-to-head strategy battler Clash Royale and city-building combat apps Game of War and Mobile Strike to reclaim the No. 1 spot. A resurgence like this suggests that the game has settled into a plateau alongside those other lucrative properties in the $36.6 billion mobile gaming industry . Niantic has not release any major updates, so it’s difficult to point to any reason why the game is floating back to the top other than the natural ebb and flow of the player spending.  In addition to the United States, Pokémon Go is still making more revenue than any other iPhone app in 15 other countries. Those include crucial markets like Canada and the United Kingdom as well as emerging regions like the Philippines. But while the its still getting players around the world to spend their cash, it is still faltering in a few spots. Most notably, Pokémon Go is only the No. 5 highest-grossing iPhone game in Japan. It is behind the messaging app Line and adventure game Shadowverse as well as Monster Strike and Puzzle & Dragons , which are the same games that have dominated Japan’s mobile-gaming sector since 2012. Alongside China and the U.S., Japan is one of the three biggest markets for spending on mobile games in the world, but most of that money has always gone to just Monster Strike and Puzzle & Dragons . Even something like Pokémon Go is struggling to change that stagnation.  Back in the U.S., Pokémon Go doesn’t top the Google Play Android app store. It is still No. 3 behind MZ’s Mobile Strike and Game of War.  Finally, developer Niantic still hasn’t launched the game in China or South Korea due to complications with how Google services work (or don’t work) in those countries. China is No.1 for mobile spending and South Korea is No. 4. The Pokémon Company that owns and controls the property has explicitly told Wall Street Journal that it wants to get the game into those territories. That untapped potential represents far more revenue than the difference between the third and first spots on the app store in the U.S. If Niantic can get the game working in China and South Korea, that could multiply the game’s revenues.

"3Scale Raises $800K For Plug-And-Play Infrastructure Solutions For Web Apis

3scale Networks , a Barcelona, Spain-based provider of API management solutions, has raised $800.000 in equity and loans from Spanish VC Inveready Seed Capital and public entities like NEOTEC and CIDEM / ACC1Ó. 3scale essentially provides a SaaS API management infrastructure solution that enables Internet-based companies to secure, control, monitor and generate revenue from the distribution and usage of their data, content and services through APIs and Web services. The company markets 3scale CONNECT , a self-service, plug-and-play solution that allows small and medium-sized API providers to enjoy a full-fledged API management infrastructure solution that can be deployed in mere minutes. The product is free for traffic volumes of up to 50.000 hits per day, which is reasonable enough for smaller API providers who are just getting started. When customers reach 1 million hits per day, 3scale charges $340 per month, and the company also boasts enterprise-grade solutions for Internet companies with higher traffic volumes of up to 10 million hits per day. “The API space is seeing massive acceleration right now and new investment will allow us to both help more new customers launch and grow their APIs and expand our solution with some great new features we have in the pipeline”, says Steven Willmott , co-founder and CEO of 3scale. “3scale solution gives you great control of your infrastructure out of the box and allows you to focus on the functionality and services you’re actually delivering rather than access management, monitoring and other infrastructure functions.” The company has signed up 25+ customers, ranging from small to enterprise, since launching in public beta in November 2008. With customers like Wine.com (they “uncorked” their API last September), By Voice and DeepDyve , 3scale’s infrastructure is already processing millions of transactions on a daily basis. But 3scale Networks is far from the only company to recognize the growing need for API management solutions – it competes heavily with other venture-backed companies like Mashery , StrikeIron and Sonoa Systems . The latter recently launched Apigee , a Twitter API dashboard .

"Iriver B30: The Sexiest Non-Touchscreen Pmp Ever?

iRiver’s always had a different aesthetic from the other media player makers. The Spinn is a good example of their different industrial design, and now this B30 (though unlikely to be released here in the US), is showing that their UI is as clean and unique as their hardware. The Korean company’s devices are also extremely versatile, wearing many hats and supporting many formats — a trend I wish would catch on here in the states. Check out this little video (apparently taken on the sly) and see how tasteful “traditional” controls can look. The B30 is a sexy-looking slab (though rather thick) and its UI is a slick and squared-off. No touchscreen, unfortunately, and the screen isn’t 16:9, but hey, that’s what the Zune HD is for, right? Good-looking devices like this should be the standard; the Sansa, while it’s a decent device, is far from imaginative yet is fairly popular. Come on, people, demand more! [via Crave ]

"Watch The Trailer For ‘Henry,’ The Second Vr Movie From Oculus Story Studio

Oculus made waves earlier this year when it announced it would be developing its own original film content for consumption on its VR devices – now there’s a second movie coming out of the Oculus Story Studio, directed by Ramiro Lopez Dau, who had a hand in both Brave and Monsters University from Pixar. Henry follows the tale of a hedgehog, starting out with an interior view of his house that you’re obviously immersed within. It’s Henry’s birthday, but he’s lonely, so he wishes for friends, which kicks off the plot of the picture. The thinking behind the short feature was to create essentially VR’s first truly hug-worthy character, according to the creators, and to build an experience that differentiates itself from epic sci-fi and more core gamer themes. Oculus is clearly looking to advertise some of its more mainstream appeal ahead of its consumer device launch next year.

"Dfj, T. Rowe Price Prescribe Another $54 Million For Doximity

Doximity, the largest professional network for the healthcare industry in the U.S., has received a new prescription for future growth with $54 million in fresh financing from investors including T. Rowe Price and the venture capital firm DFJ. The new round is further validation for the thesis that professionals in different industries benefit from targeted social networks. In the past four months investors have committed significant dollars to Wattpad , the creative writing social network; SpiceWorks , the social networking platform for programmers and developers; and the social network for lawyers, Avvo . In all, these companies have raised roughly $200 million since January. And San Francisco-based Doximity is already in the pole position when it comes to penetration in the U.S. healthcare industry. The network counts roughly one in three doctors as members on the network (that’s more members than the American Medical Association), and is continuing to roll out new services. The addition of big financial backers like T. Rowe Price and funds and accounts managed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which also participated in Doximity’s latest financing, means that this is probably the company’s last round before its initial public offering. Doximity’s executives are mum about timing for its future financing plans, but company chief executive Jeff Tangney says that the company’s latest financing will be spent on new products and services and expanding its network of healthcare professionals. “We’re moving from 40% to 70% [enrollment] and expanding internationally,” says Tangney. The company already generates revenue through its recruitment service, and has also added an education and certification component to its offerings for the medical community in recent months. That continuing education component is done through a partnership with the Cleveland Clinic which began roughly nine months ago. Physicians can expect to see more partnerships with institutions like hospitals and health centers coming from Doximity later in the year. The company is working with two hospitals on the West Coast to do pilot programs that will help the institutions manage referrals, and integrate those referrals with the transfer of electronic health recrods. “We’re making it easier to refer patients into their hospital so a doctor can send patient information into someone like a surgeon and have that surgeon reply back,” Tangney says. The company also plans to offer more medical education offerings and a program that Tangney called a “TurboTax for credentialing”. Secure communications are also critical for the medical profession, and Doximity has plans to add to its suite of messaging tools as well. “It reminds me of a joke,” Tangney says of the current state of communications tools for physicians. “‘Who has pagers? Doctors and drug dealers have pagers.’ But actually the drug dealers have moved on.” In all, Doximity has raised $81 million for its services as it has evolved from a social network to a service provider for communications, continuing education, recruitment and referrals in the medical community. Previous investors in the company include Emergence Capital Partners, InterWest Partners, and Morgenthaler Ventures. “Think of social networks as a new operating system,” says Konstantin Guericke, the co-founder of LinkedIn who joined Doximity’s board of directors in 2012. “We’re all social animals, so that’s the new level of the operating system.” And like an operating system, Doximity’s proliferation has created opportunities for other medical applications. The company’s application program interface is used by companies like Figure 1, the medical image management service DICOMgrid and itMD , another image sharing application. “We’re trying to bring medical communication into the 21st century,” Tangney says.

"Microsoft Updates Outlook For Ios With Sunrise-Inspired Features

Following Microsoft’s acquisition and today’s shutdown of the beloved mobile calendaring application Sunrise , the company announced this morning an upgraded Outlook application which now features Bing map integrations, event icons, plus something it’s calling “Interesting Calendars,” and other new features – many of which were inspired by Sunrise, and its unique design. “Interesting Calendars” were previously introduced on Outlook on the web earlier this month for Office 365 and new Outlook.com accounts. Now, it’s expanding to mobile. The addition will allow Outlook mobile users to subscribe to various event calendars – like those for sports teams, or TV shows, and more. These new calendars are available in the Outlook app for iOS, with an Android launch to follow. It also currently requires users to have an Office 365 email address, though people with Outlook.com emails will be able to use the new feature later this year, as will Gmail users, says Microsoft. In addition to the “Interesting Calendars,” Outlook will also now integrate with Bing Maps to help you plan where to meet and to locate your appointments. To use this option, you can start typing in the name of a location when you’re creating an event, and Outlook will update the event with a map. When it’s time for your meeting, you can then tap the map to be directed to the venue from your preferred mapping application.  The new app will introduce new ways to help users schedule appointments, too – something Microsoft credits Sunrise for, in terms of the design of these new date and time pickers. Another Sunrise feature making an appearance in the new release is the debut of event icons. That means when you type in something like “coffee” or “lunch” when creating an event, those keywords will trigger a particular icon that matches the event to appear. This makes it easier to see, at a glance, what sort of meetings you have on your agenda for the day. Sunrise users will note there’s an expanded selection of these icon types, Microsoft says. Other improvements in the updated version of Outlook include the ability to edit recurring meetings from your mobile device (and soon, the ability to create recurring events), and the ability to create Skype for Business meetings. (Skype meetings integration was already supported, which lets users join calls just by tapping.) Microsoft notes that Skype for Business is only rolled out to 75% of the user base at the time being, but the remaining users should see the new option shortly. However, for Sunrise users, Outlook still falls short from what the startup had offered. For example, users can’t attach an iCloud account not associated with an iCloud email because Microsoft only looks for calendars that are associated with email accounts. The app is still missing many integrations, like TripIt, Eventbrite, ToDoList, and others. Facebook events aren’t yet displayed properly, as they will show up in your calendar even if you haven’t RSVP’d. Outlook is missing many Sunrise gestures, too, like swiping to switch to the week view – now you have to tap a few times, for instance. However, the company is encouraging users to request the features they want to see next via an in-app feedback option you can access to by going to Settings > Suggest a Feature in the new app.

"The 11 Best Election Apps To Keep You In The Know

  With the Republican National Convention starting today in Tampa, the 2012 election enters its most intense phase. Thanks to our smartphones and social networks, there have never been more ways to get information on the candidates and events of the season.  Through social networks and mobile apps, you can watch live-streams from the conventions, read news, brush up on the issues, play trivia, donate, and volunteer. It can be a little overwhelming, but that’s how it is when we have access to so many virtual channels.  Both Romney and Obama have released official apps for their campaigns. I’m only including Obama’s mobile app on this list because Romney’s two apps, With Mitt and Mitt’s VP , are incredibly limited. “With Mitt” lets you take a picture of yourself or someone else, add a Romney stencil, and post it on social networks. (The app became famous for misspelling America as “Amercia.”) The “Mitt’s VP” app’s only purpose was to let you know who Romney’s Vice Presidential choice was, and that app wasn’t very good at that job, either. Weirdly, there is no official Romney app that outlines the candidate’s views and events being held to support him; if there were, we’d include it here.  Since there are so many options for ways to get your election info, we’ve outlined the 10 best mobile and social apps for connecting with campaigns. Take a look at the alphabetical list below.  1. Ad Hawk   Platforms: Android and iOS  Have you ever wondered which Super PAC was in charge of an ad? The Sunlight Foundation’s Ad Hawk can listen to any political ad being aired and then give you information on which organization is behind it and what backers are involved in that organization. Essentially, it’s the SoundHound for political ads .  2. CNN ‘I’m Voting’ Facebook app   Platform: Facebook  CNN’s new “I’m Voting” app adds voter participation with social media . It can give insight into who people on Facebook are voting for and give you an easy way to voice your political opinions on your Facebook Timeline. While user participation in the app is low thus far, we still appreciate the concept of pushing more people to vote and be proud of it. CNN also has a cool new app called Election Insights that ties to Facebook.  3. DNC 2012   Platforms: Android and iOS  The Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. doesn’t begin until Sept. 4, but the DNC already has a silky-smooth and smartly designed app ready to go. The DNC’s official app offers a look at the convention schedule, press releases, information about Charlotte locales, live videos, photos, maps, and social media updates. It also lets you tag “favorites” among the content and places so you can access or read it later.  4. Google+ Hangouts   Platform: Google+  Google+ Hangouts are already pretty cool, but now Hangouts will create a new interactive experience for those watching the Democratic and Republican national conventions online . Viewers will be able to watch Hangouts featuring representatives of both political parties and organizers for the conventions. These folks will be chatting with reporters from outlets including the New York Times, NBC, Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, and the Huffington Post.  5. NBC Politics   Platform: iOS  If you’re political news junkie, the NBC Politics app for iOS and iPad is one of the best places to get the latest on the campaigns. The app is slick and well-designed, with photos, news, and analysis of the conventions and anything else that becomes part of the news cycle. When the polling comes in on election night, the app will update in real-time as well to help you keep track of who’s winning. Politico’s mobile apps for iOS and Android provide similarly good news, analysis, and election coverage.  Check out apps 6 through 10.   1  2  View All

"Microsoft Will Push Windows 10 As A ‘Recommended Update’ Next Year

 Microsoft announced today that it’s making changes to the way it handles upgrades to Windows 10.  Soon Microsoft will mark Windows 10 as an “optional update” in Windows Update on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, and early next year Microsoft will go further and designate Windows 10 as a “recommended update” in Windows Update.  “Depending upon your Windows Update settings, this may cause the upgrade process to automatically initiate on your device,” Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Microsoft’s Windows and Devices Group, wrote in a blog post today. “Before the upgrade changes the OS of your device, you will be clearly prompted to choose whether or not to continue. And of course, if you choose to upgrade (our recommendation!), then you will have 31 days to roll back to your previous Windows version if you don’t love it.”  This change — which can result in automatic downloads — should help Microsoft boost Windows 10 adoption above the “more than 110 million devices” level it is at now and get it closer to the company’s goal of 1 billion devices.  Microsoft has previously made PCs automatically download Windows 10 in order to speed up installation — although you can prevent that from happening. And earlier this month, Microsoft came out and said it was a “mistake” to have the checkbox for an “optional” update checked by default ; the company said it would remove Windows 10 from Windows Update for those who had not made a reservation for a copy of the new operating system, which Microsoft released in late July.  Now that Windows 10 has built up a solid installed base, Microsoft is going to stop asking people to start the upgrade if they’ve already made a reservation for Windows 10, Myerson wrote.  And in the settings pages for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, you can now tell Windows to stop showing notifications about upgrading to Windows 10, he wrote.  Microsoft also has a new way to deal with people with “non-genuine” — a nice way to say “pirated” — versions of Windows. Myerson explained:  One of the more interesting learnings from the upgrade is the creative efforts which non-Genuine customers have gone to, to initiate the upgrade process on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 – and then how many have purchased Genuine Windows 10 activation through the Windows 10 store.  Following these learnings, we are going to start an experiment soon in the United States, which we will then evaluate before extending to other countries, to ease the upgrade of non-Genuine Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. We’ll offer a one-click opportunity to get Genuine via the Windows Store or by entering an activation code purchased elsewhere. If this turns into a path for most customers to get Genuine, we will expand the experiment. We’d like to welcome as many of these customers as possible to the legitimate Windows ecosystem.  Microsoft is also updating its Media Creation tool for upgrading many devices to Windows 10. Soon it will allow people to “create a single image capable of upgrading any 32bit or 64bit, Home or Pro, device,” Myerson wrote.

"Choose Your Side: Balancing The Autobot Versus Decepticon War In Transformers Universe

 In the Transformers war, it’s Autobots versus Decepticons. Two sides, one battle. But balancing an online game — based on a 30-year-old toy, comic, and movie franchise — where players make such a defining choice is tough.  At a recent preview event in London, Jagex revealed its vision for Transformers Universe, a free-to-play online game that pits teams of players against each other in fast, frantic but tactical combat across a range of maps and terrains. With competitive and cooperative elements in place, the developer hopes it will appeal to both hardcore and casual gamers.  Jagex chief executive officer Mark Gerhard told GamesBeat that the two-team nature of Transformers Universe has been the subject of much internal debate, sharing his plans for balancing and letting us in to a secret or two in the process.  Autobots versus Decepticons  “I think Hasbro would say that it’s almost a religious choice,” said Gerhard, during an interview after the preview screening. “You’re either a Decepticon or an Autobot.”  At first, Jagex thought that player balance would favor Optimus Prime’s side. “Conventional wisdom would say everyone wants to be an Autobot, because they’re the good guys,” said Gerhard. “Maybe 70-30.“  But what they’ve actually found, from players signing up to join the closed beta test, is the opposite. “What we discovered is that the bad-ass Decepticons are pretty cool, and actually there seems to be almost like an edge or a tone to it. We’re worried it’s going to be 60-40 in favor of Decepticons”  So, if there are significantly more players on one team signed up, what’s that going to look like for players?  Gerhard explained that battle times  — the time you’re waiting to join a game — will help balance this. “Say right now the battle time for an Autobot is 1 minute and 7 seconds — a Decepticon might be 49 seconds,” said Gerhard. “Or something like that.”  Jagex won’t know actual player distributions this summer’s launch. “It’ll be very cool at the end of the day to see what the number are,” said Gerhard. “My instincts are Decepticons will be slightly more popular.”  Above: Transformers Universe is a free-to-play game due out this summer. Image Credit: Jagex  For players who don’t approach Transformers with such religious fervor, Gerhard explained they will have an option to switch sides.  “There is a wall that you can climb over to be both sides,” he said. “Were not going to lock you in one forever.”  “It’s a high wall,” he added, “but I think a lot of people keep climbing it because you’re going to want to play on both sides.”  Gerhard wouldn’t go into detail about the team-switching process and whether it was time or experience limited. “You can swap over, but were not offering it as a choice every time,” was all he would say.  Gerhard himself signed up as an Autobot commander initially, but he has played the beta mostly as a Decepticon tank. He didn’t clarify if this was a tank in the literal or metaphorical sense. “Maybe I’m one of those guys that crosses over to both sides,” he said.  Building two Transformer armies  Above: Transformers Universe vice president David Nicholson. Image Credit: Jagex  The core concept in Transformers Universe is that you’re a commander, tasked with deploying and controlling a squad of Transformers. Jagex chief creative officer Alex Horton likened it to a trading card game, where you’re collecting the best selection of bots that you can get. Choosing which Transformer to send into battle at any one point will be key to success.  “Different bots have different roles,” explained Transformers Universe vice president David Nicholson in a round table session. “Really, you want to have a stable full of bots that can cover any scenario,” he said. Or, if you prefer, you can take one type of bot — say, a healing type — and collect together different bots of that one type.  “You start with a small number of bots that we give you,” Nicholson said. “As you progress, through going out and completing some of the battles, or doing well in battles, we’ll reward you with in-game currency [Energon].” Players can earn Energon in solo or cooperative modes as well as in player-versus-player battles, or they can buy it with real money.  You can then buy individual bots with Energon or use it to improve an existing bot. “You don’t unlock them on specific achievements,” said Nicholson, “… apart from very, very special bots later on.”   Jagex has created all the original Transformers featured in the game — such as Duststorm, Firebreaker, and Showdown — from scratch, working closely with brand owner Hasbro.  “The IP [intellectual property] has been going for the last 30 years,” said art director Gerard Miley, pointing out that Jagex was free to draw on the entire range of Transformer generations for inspiration. “Universe is a key word,” he added, while also noting the key influence of the Transformers Prime animated television series. “The DNA of Prime is in our game,” he said.  Hasbro has no Transformers manual to use when creating a new bot, “so it’s really just studying the visual language of it,” said Miley. “Using clever shapes and a little bit of trickery to get the transformations working.”  “Each one’s got its own unique back story and great transformation,” Nicholson said. Each also has a “big show-off move,” unique weapons, and different special abilities, he explained.  “The variety of bots from a visual perspective is very important,” Miley said. “You’ve got the vehicles but they represent their personalities. Their personalities represent their combat style, and so on.”  Above: The legendary Transformers Optimus Prime and Megatron will be playable in Transformers Universe. Image Credit: Hub Network  The legendary Transformers  Neither Miley nor Nicholson would put a figure on the number of playable Transformers we’d see at launch this summer, only willing to put it at somewhere between 10 and a hundred.  Right now, all the Transformers are land-based, but that’s not all Jagex has in store. “You’ve got little fast male and female bikes,” said Miley, “then you’ve got trucks and cars, then you can go even bigger again — we haven’t shown a snip of what we’re doing.”  While Miley and Nicholson wouldn’t reveal any further details, Mark Gerhard wasn’t so coy. “We’re going to start flying,” he said. “We’re going to do some really cool things. [But] not all that’s going to be ready by summer.”  “We will also be featuring your legendary Transformers,” Gerhard told me, “like Optimus [Prime], Bumblebee, [and] Megatron, into the game itself.”  When I asked him if they’d be part of the story, and not playable characters, Gerhard was quite clear. “They’ll be playable, too,” he revealed.  Above: Hasbro is bringing the new Transformers Universe creations to toy stores. Image Credit: Jagex  From screen to toy store  Working so closely with Hasbro has yielded some great cross-promotion opportunities for Transformers Universe.  “It’s been a tremendous relationship,” said Gerhard. “They’ve been really blown away by how we’ve paid homage to the brand.”  With that in mind, Gerhard told me that Hasbro “has taken a number of bots we’ve created and turned them into a toy line.”  The toys won’t interact with the game, as we’ve seen with titles like Skylanders and Disney Infinity, but their presence on toy store shelves will be a great boost to the Transformers Universe brand as well as vindicating the quality of Jagex’s original Transformer designs.  While Hasbro itself is “superkeen” to promote the game on this toy line, Gerhard is wary that most of the people who buy the toys are quite young. He wants the game itself to be well received within the industry and with older gamers before leveraging the “extra footfall” that the toy line would create. “I think it’s a fantastic enhancer,” he said.  What’s been revealed of Transformers Universe so far backs up Alex Horton’s claim that this is “not just another licensed game to go on the bonfire of licensed games.” Indeed, Jagex is hoping that it will be around for the next ten years or more. “Everything we’re doing,” said Gerhard, “the lore we’re creating, is to set up the next decade”   This is part two of our Transformers Universe preview.

"Assassin’S Creed Producer Gets His 1666 Game Back From Ubisoft

 When defunct publisher THQ collapsed, it looked like one of the more interesting games it was working on would get lost forever. But its original creator has rescued it.  Assassin’s Creed producer Patrice Désilets has worked out a deal with publisher Ubisoft to get back the rights to his unfinished historical action game 1666. This also marks the end of the legal battle between the two parties that began when Ubisoft allegedly fired Désilets after purchasing 1666 (and the studio making it) during a THQ asset auction in 2013 . Ubisoft ended development on 1666 a week after parting with Désilets, and that led the ousted producer to promise legal action to get it back.  Now, all of that is over as Ubisoft has agreed to give all “creative and business control” over 1666 to Désilets.  We don’t now much about 1666, but it has the subtitle “Amsterdam,” and Ubisoft paid $2.5 million for the property and the THQ Montreal team (which never released a game) during the 2013 auction. For comparison, Ubisoft also purchased the right to make South Park games at the same time for $3.27 million. Considering Désilets is one of the people primarily responsible for turning Assassin’s Creed into one of the largest franchises in the $99.6 billion gaming industry, 1666 could have a lot of potential.  Friends, Ubi and I agreed, I got it back! :) https://t.co/lKqj5enJth  #1666Amsterdam  pic.twitter.com/Z19MLwdgEY  — Patrice Desilets (@PatriceDez) April 25, 2016   “Putting aside our past differences, Patrice and I are above all interested in the creation of videogames and the evolution of this medium of entertainment,” Ubisoft Montreal and Toronto chief executive Yannis Mallat said in a canned statement. “This agreement is good news for everyone. Ubisoft’s creative teams are currently working on innovative projects that will mark our industry for years to come. This is precisely where we want to focus our energy: on our teams, to continue what we have been building in Quebec for nearly 20 years. As we have always said, Patrice is a talented designer, and we wish him all the best in the development of his future endeavors.”  Désilets also provided a statement alongside Ubisoft where he confirmed that he does not plan to immediately go back to working on 1666. Instead, he’s going to continue production of the game he announced with his new studio, Panache Digital Games — Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey.  “I’m glad Ubisoft and I were able to come to an agreement that will allow me to obtain the rights to project 1666 Amsterdam,” he said. “I will now devote myself entirely to the development of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, my next game with Panache Digital Games. This is what matters most to me today: making the best games and showing the world the creative talent of Quebecers. I also wish every success to the Ubisoft teams.”

"Keen On… Don’T Steal This Book (Tctv)

“Steal this book,” wrote Abbie Hoffman in 1970. So, today, why should we pay for our books – especially in a digital age where intellectual theft is both ubiquitous and pretty much risk free? According to Gary Shteyngart, the best-selling author of novels like “Super Sad True Love Story” and “Absurdistan,” paying for his books means that he doesn’t have to work at a gas station or a car dealership. When we pay for one of his books, Shteyngart explained when we spoke earlier this week, it “allows me to produce more work.” Buying a book, he insists, represents an investment in creativity. And creativity – real creativity – may be at a premium today – at least according to Shteyngart. As he argues, the Internet may be killing our eccentricity and transforming all of us into 140-character conformists. Thus, in today’s networked age, he says, there is an acute need for writers who can grab our attention and drag us away from broadcasting our boring selves on Facebook and Twitter. This is the second in a two-part interview with Shteyngart. Yesterday, he explained why, in the not-too-distant future, everyone will know everything about everybody. Don’t steal this book  How to get to William Gibson land  Have words lost their power?

"Gift Guide: Graphic Novels Worth Buying In Print

Sometimes it’s nice to share a good book, and if you know me then you know that most of the books I’m buying are comics and graphic novels. These are a few of my absolute favorites this year and I recommend picking up a solid, meaty hardcover and hanging onto it for a few years. You know, like the old days. My Friend Dahmer by Derf Backderf – Backderf explores his life in suburban Cleveland where he grew up with a young Jeffrey Dahmer . The story is all true and it’s a fascinating look at what happens before the terror of mental illness and horrible decisions takes Dahmer down a path of absolute darkness. We’re lucky that Backderf was the chronicler of Dahmer’s early years because this heartfelt picture tells you what the boy was like before he let his desires control him. Parker: The Score by Darwyn Cooke – The Parker novels by Robert Westlake (writing as Richard Stark) are some of the most fascinating pieces of crime fiction you can read. Rather than milquetoast detectives spouting hardball wisdom, you get a calm, collected criminal who treats a heist like a job. These graphic novels feature some of the best Parker stories in graphic novel format, adding a nice taste of 1950s-era design to the proceedings. Don’t Forget This Song by Frank M. Young and David Lasky – If you’ve ever wondered how the Carter family came to be – and didn’t want the saccharine stories of pious gospel singers making it big – this is the book for you. It tells the real story behind the group’s success and eventual ascendency from turn of the century troubadours into mavens of the modern music business. A Wrinkle In Time by Madeleine L’Engle’s and Hope Larson – L’Engle’s classic in comic form. It’s great for kids who, for whatever reason, don’t feel like reading about the eternal mysteries of the universe as explained by precocious kids who live in the Heartland and instead want to see those kids, odd little Charles Wallace included, in a great graphic novel. Robot Dreams by Sara Varon – This is my favorite kids book of all time and it’s great for adults as well. It’s a bit old by now and Varon has another title out about cupcakes, but this is the one to get for the kid or kid-like adult in your life. I won’t spoil the story but let’s just say it involves raccoons, ducks, robot friends, and a team of really mean monkeys in a boat.

"33Across Signs Project Nursery As 1 Millionth Publisher, Expands Reach And Scale Of Its Intent Signal Platform

 The Intent Signal Platform Delivers Incremental Revenue for       Publishers by Enabling Advertising Triggered From Native Consumer Search       and Share Actions  NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–March 4, 2014– 33Across ( www.33Across.com ),       a leading advertising technology company, today announced its first       milestone since the launch of its Intent Signal Platform two weeks ago       with the signing of its one millionth publisher partner, Project       Nursery. Other premium publishers currently employing the Intent Signal       Platform include the Kiplinger, Sports Illustrated and Time. As search       and content sharing continue to become more prominent among consumers,       publishers are beginning to realize the value of utilizing that behavior       to increase brand awareness and accrue incremental revenue.  “The amount of traffic driven to publisher sites from search and content       sharing continues to grow dramatically,” said Eric Wheeler, CEO of       33Across. “Our data recently revealed that 50 percent of site visitors       come from search and social traffic, representing an untapped       opportunity to deliver relevant advertising to consumers and more       revenue to publishers. This realization was one of the driving forces       behind the creation of our Intent Signal Platform. Not only is it       important for publishers to capture this kind of activity and insight,       but also action upon it by delivering smarter and better ad units to       those consumers that signaled the highest level of intent.”  33Across recently found that more than 80 percent of social referrals       were driven from Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. Today, publishers are       looking to understand these consumer behaviors and are interested in       solutions that allow them to better monetize and connect with audiences       through these activities. 33Across’ Intent Signal Platform makes these       connections with consumers possible by offering a better and smarter way       to engage audiences while also making sure to add value to the overall       site experience.  Through 33Across’ Intent Signal Solutions, a whole new class of       advertising was created to address social referral traffic in a high       impact and relevant way. Publishers are now able to advertise to       consumers landing on their sites from a social channel and deliver an       Intent Impact Unit based on the consumer’s previous activity and the       relevant content on the page. However, the Intent Impact Units are only       served to those consumers that displayed high intent signals-meaning       these ad units are only served to a fraction of the publisher’s readers,       whom display the highest likelihood of conversion.  “As a digital publisher, advertising is a necessity for running a       profitable business, but it’s incredibly important to make sure those       ads do not tarnish the brand or experience that we are creating at       Project Nursery,” said Melisa Fluhr at Project Nursery. “With 33Across’       Intent Impact Units, highly relevant ads are served in a native format       only to those readers that show the highest level of intent. This allows       us to maintain the user experience of our site, while also offering       additional value to our readers.”  Publishers deploy the Intent Signal Platform by placing a simple line of       JavaScript code on their pages. The embedded code makes it possible for       the company to identify consumer intent from billions of search and       sharing activities across each publisher and social sharing site. With       this intent data, publishers are then able to employ 33Across’ Intent       Impact Units to deliver premium, “in-view,” high impact ads that result       in a 1.5 percent click through rate, on average.  The intent signals identified and analyzed by the Intent Signal Platform       are used to power two cross-platform ad products-Intent Signal Solutions       and Intent Modeling Solutions. The Intent Signal Solutions’ performance       lies in its ability to  reach consumers at key moments of       discovery with high-impact creative and new “in-view” ad placements.       While 33Across’ Intent Modeling Solutions combine real-time data from       the platform with first-party advertiser data and offline purchase data       to create customized prospect profiles.

"Apple Updates Imac With New Intel Processors, Speedy 802.11Ac Wi-Fi And Faster Flash Storage

Apple has just released an updated version of its iMac all-in-one computer . The update is a minor one, unlike the considerable redesign it got at the end of last year, but it brings brand new improved performance and internal specs to the iMac line. New features include Intel quad core processors, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and faster PCIe-based flash storage. These new iMacs now feature a 2.7GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor on the base 21.5-inch model, which is the first desktop with Intel’s Crystalwell architecture, and new Iris Pro graphics. Iris Pro is a new Intel GPU that’s popular on mid-range gaming PCs, and should offer considerable improvements over the previous model. There are also CTO options up to 3.4GHz Core i5 Haswell processors, and NVIDIA GeForce 700 series graphics on the top model, with up to 4GB of dedicated memory. 802.11ac networking means the new iMacs can work with the latest AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule routers, which introduced that wireless standard earlier this year. PCIe-based flash storage should offer speed improvements of up to 50 percent over last-gen models, according to Apple, for faster booting, loading of apps and general system performance. All-flash CTO options now range up to a full 1 TB of storage, with Fusion Drives available in either 1TB or 3TB. 8GB of RAM and a 1TB drive are now standard, with 32GB max configuration options for custom orders. Apple starts selling the new iMac today on its website, and in stores as well, according to its press release. Customers can choose between stand-mounted versions, and ones with built-in VESA adapters if they’re mounting on their own swingarms or other hardware. Prices start at $1,299, and range up to $1,999 for base configurations. The top-end 27-inch model offers up to 40 percent faster graphics, and combined with PCIe and the new Intel Haswell quad-core processors, that’s a might attractive package for anyone doing some gaming or heavy-duty video editing. Plus, it’s all wrapped up in the slimmer body design, which, as mentioned in my review of last year’s model , is a big improvement on the iMac’s aesthetics.

"Yelp Finishes Ipo Day Strong With 63% Gain

  Reviews website Yelp debuted today on the New York Stock Exchange at $15 a share and closed the day at $24.52 , a 63% gain from the original price.  It was questionable how well Yelp would perform, considering the company earned just $83.3 million in net revenue in 2011 and lost $16.7 million during the same period. The site touts about 66 million monthly unique visitors, but it’s not exactly killin’ it when it comes actually making money. At the very least, Yelp raised more than $107 million with its IPO.  Yelp’s shares were priced at $15 a share last night, but when the stock actually become available on the market this morning, it started at about $22. That indicates non-institutional investors likely weren’t able to get their hands on the offering until it hit the market. The highest price point in trading for the stock was $26.00 in early trading.  At this point, we will have to see how Yelp continues to perform. PrivCo CEO Sam Hamadeh told VentureBeat yesterday that Yelp’s long-term prospects aren’t pretty, citing the company’s inability to turn a profit, competition from Facebook and Google, and low annual revenue.  “Beyond the opening day of trading, we don’t think Yelp will perform well given its many business model issues,” Hamadeh said. “Yelp can’t seem to be able to lose less as it grows, showing the unattractiveness of a business model based primarily on local advertising salespeople to sell to small local merchants.”  How do you think Yelp will perform long term?

"The Lesson Of Monument Valley

Editor’s note: Tadhg Kelly is a games industry consultant, freelance designer and the creator of leading design blog What Games Are . You can follow him on Twitter here . I’m fascinated by the reviews left by Monument Valley players in the wake of the decision by the game’s developer (ustwo) to price a recent content update at not-free. Ustwo had released the original game at $4 featuring 10 levels. The game was a labor of love and earned many just awards. It also went to sell in excess of 1.4 million copies – a feat that exemplifies how arty mobile gaming can work very well. This latest pack brings 8 new levels to the game and costs a pretty trivial $2. And yet in its wake came a surge of 1-star reviews . But why? On the face of it it seems petulant to review a game so harshly over such a small amount of money. You can’t buy much for two dollars after all. I suppose you could take yourself off to Dollar Tree and buy two stuffed toys for a buck each and pray they aren’t flammable. You could pop into a Starbucks and buy a Grande Fresh Brewed Coffee, or to McDonalds and acquire a Medium Fries , and have a few cents to spare. But not both. Or you could throw two bucks into a hit game to buy the fruits of many moons of hard work and obtain hours of further enjoyment. When you say it like that this sounds like a fair deal, no? A trip to go see Interstellar would cost you 5x-10x as much (and wouldn’t be half as much fun) while a fancy dinner out would cost you 30x-100x as much as Monument Valley: Forgotten Shores . More if you wanted to really go nuts. It seems simple, obvious even, that at these kinds of prices games offer fantastic value and that anyone getting such a good deal would be nothing other than overjoyed. But some folks just do not see it that way. Price in mobile (or indeed any) platform is one of those issues that’s easy to misjudge. I often hear developers paint it as an example of entitlement or overly-expectant customers. As a developer it’s comforting to think that some players are a bit selfish, always on the take and that the task of getting better ARPU is necessarily adversarial. From indies through to casino folks, that mentality leads to thinking about how much can be got from how little. And it tends to lead to confirmation bias because someone somewhere will always behave like a dick. But when consumers react in groups, such as in Monument Valley ’s case, there’s more to it than that. It’s about perception. As developers we make the mistake of thinking that players are automata in systems that sometimes convert them into money. Or we make the mistake of thinking that players are noble aesthetes who want to engage with us on the very highest levels. We over-infer the impact of some decisions and under-infer others. We make the case in our own minds, for example, that putting free-to-play in our games is actually about choice (and then South Park makes fun at our expense ). We make the case for price points or charging strategies on what we feel should be true (rather than actually is true). The thing is it’s not the actual amount that matters. It’s whether you understand what you are selling, or rather what your players think they’re buying. As a game developer or publisher you might see your work as a product, something bought and sold. Therefore it seems fair that you charge in a semi-commoditized fashion. I gave you 10 levels for X, I want to sell you 8 levels for X/2. Good deal! But players often see their purchase more in the light of a commuter ticket or a pass to a buffet. They judge less on volume of content and more on quality of experience. And having paid for the ticket to go visit your world they feel it’s fair that they can continue to go there. And so they feel aggrieved in situations where extra conditions are then stapled onto that ticket. I first witnessed this kind of furore in the selling of horse armor as a special item in the Xbox 360 version of Oblivion (2006). In Oblivion’s case the scenario was that the game’s developers sold this extra item as downloadable content for a price over and above the basic game, and fans were up in arms as they are with Monument Valley today. It seemed to violate this sense of having bought an All-You-Can-Eat pass and caused a stink. Oblivion sold a lot of horse armor. I imagine ustwo will do the same with Monument Valley’s Forgotten Shores levels despite the gripes. Indeed many of their fans followed on from a social media campaign to correct the 1-star reviews with reviews of their own, bringing everything back to an even keel pretty quickly. But does that mean there was no problem at all? No. The aura of these kinds of events can play through a franchise for many years. Oblivion’s horse armor episode, for example, is regularly featured in “ most ignominious things to happen in gaming ” lists. It left a dissatisfied air. As mobile gaming in particular looks to expand its remit and become a deeper venue for games as well as just a player and revenue destination, sensitivity to how players think becomes more important. If you do intend to make mobile games and try to capture their “cool” market, be aware of what you’re really selling.

"Techcrunch Disrupt Winner Getaround Off To A Good Start

 Getaround , the startup that offers a marketplace for personal car rentals, was named the winner of TechCrunch Disrupt NYC .  The company bested 32 other competing startups, including runners-up Billguard and Sonar , to win  $50,000 and a ton of valuable media exposure. But judges were not the only ones who thought Getaround was a great idea, as the company was also voted the Audience Choice winner.  Getaround offers a marketplace where people can rent their car to others and/or rent one themselves. Car owners set the rental availability while Getaround handles things like insurance, 24-hour roadside assistance, searching for available vehicles and such.  Although the company has been public less than a week, 1,600 cars are signed up for the service, according to Getaround’s founder. For some perspective, that’s about 20 percent of similar car sharing service Zipcar’s 8,000 fleet of vehicles.  As noted in our past coverage , the service also has plenty of advantages over the competition.  Rental prices, which are set by the car owners, are generally cheaper  than Zipcar or traditional car rental companies. Getaround also doesn’t  have the problem with expanding like Zipcar does, since it doesn’t have  to worry about deploying and maintaining a fleet of cars. It’s also just  as useful in less densely populated areas as it is in cities.  RelayRides , another  car-sharing startup in Boston, offers a very similar service, but at  this point it seems like Getaround is pushing to build a more social  marketplace.

"Union Square'S New $165 Million Fund Is All About Growing With The Network

Back in December, we spotted an SEC filing indicating that Union Square Ventures was raising between $135 million and $200 million for a new “Opportunity Fund.”  The offering wasn’t complete and the firm could not discuss it, but today partner Fred Wilson explains in a post what the new fund (which ended up being a $165 million fund) is all about. The fund is not about going after different opportunities than Union Square has been focussed on since the outset.  It is that the size of the opportunity Union Square is focussed on—which Wilson describes “Internet services that create large networks”—is larger than ever.  And the new fund will provide more dry powder to invest in network startups, whether they need $25,000 or $25 million.  Wilson explains: Union Square is an investor in Twitter, Zynga, Tumblr, Foursquare, and Disqus—all of which fit under the network thesis.  As these companies grow and command higher valuations in private rounds (Union Square sat out Twitter’s latest $200 million round ), the Opportunity Fund will allow Union Square to keep participating.  It will also be tapped to invest in companies in later rounds (something Union Square has shied away from so far, they like to be first) and other special situations such as spin-offs.  Interestingly, Union Square is not committing to invest all the money raised. Maybe they should have called it the Dry Powder Fund instead.

"Sony Clarifies Vita ‘Legacy Platform’ Statement: ‘Our Portable Business Will Be Continued’

 The Vita may yet live.  Earlier today , we reported that Sony Computer Entertainment chief executive officer Andrew House didn’t have many plans for the PlayStation Vita as part of his company’s strategy for 2015. He even referred to the Vita as a “legacy platform,” but Sony is now clarifying that label only applies to older models of the handheld.  “What Andy mentioned as ‘legacy platform’ was part of the write-off for PS Vita components for the first generation of the PS Vita, which is no longer available in the market,” a Sony spokesperson said in a statement provided to GamesBeat. “And he did not directly mean the current PS Vita and PS TV models, which are available in the market. Our portable business will be continued, and many users are now enjoying PlayStation 4 remote play features as well as original PS Vita game titles on PS Vita and PS TV.”  In remarks to investors, House said that the Vita is “strong and vibrant” in Asia, but he didn’t explain how the handheld fits into the company’s attempts to broaden its reach or increase the average amount of money consumers spend on PlayStation products. Those are the core areas that House wants his teams to focus on going through the end of the year, and he highlighted the game-streaming service PlayStation Now and the TV-delivery service PlayStation Vue as ways to accomplish that.  But these clarified remarks suggest that the company may still try to fit the Vita into its plans, and it will have the opportunity to prove that in the coming weeks as the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show begins in mid-June in Los Angeles.

"Rhombus Lets Businesses Accept Payments By Text

Since millennials don’t use credit cards, cash, or even beads and shells, the only way to get them to pay for anything is through their smartphone. Add in a text-to-pay service like Rhombus and you’ve got Williamsburg catnip. This new app allows people to pay you via a special contact number. For example, a customer can text you an order – “five large soy chai latte soylents with almond milk” – and you can request cash. The system lets them confirm payment and it’s automatically debited from their account. Rhombus was created by Edwin Elodimuor and Taiwo Oyeniyi, two fintech gurus who worked at Navigant Consultin and Goldman Sachs respectively. Oyeniyi has a Masters in Computer Science and Elodimuor one in Economics. The system is live and has seen about $400,000 in transactions. They’ve processed 3,656 charges and there are over a hundred merchants on the platform. Unlike Venmo the system doesn’t require an app. Instead, users simply text a special business number and all of the transactions are performed between the customer and the business. “We started Rhombus to solve our own problems,” said Oyeniyi. “My co-founder and I really wanted a simple way to send donations to our local church, which typically collected cash or checks in paper envelopes every Sunday. We quickly saw interest from regular businesses that wanted a better way to accept payments. Adding messaging felt like a natural extension of that simplicity we offered our merchants and customers.” The system works with any phone and requires no hardware. The system can also text you a list of Rhombus-enabled businesses. “Customers don’t have to signup to chat with businesses, it’s like texting anyone on your contact list. Paying for things within the conversation is as simple as texting the amount you wish to send to the business,” said Oyeniyi. While the service still requires you to interact with a human at least once, primarily when picking up your protein cupcake, reducing the total payment friction sounds like a great thing.

"Datasift To Offer Access To Historical Tweets

Twitter developers have long been pining for access to historical Tweets. Right now, the best they can get is 7 days worth based on keyword search. DataSift , one of Twitter’s data partners which currently provides developers and third parties with a ccess to the full Twitter firehose in realtime, will soon make historical Tweets accessible as well.  Developers can sign up for the Alpha of DataSift’s Historical Data starting today (the actual service will begin to roll out in the first quarter of next year). DataSift’s Historical service will give developers, social media monitoring companies, marketers, and brands access to 60 days of tweets for the Alpha, which can be analyzed and filtered beyond simple keyword search. When the service is launched more broadly later next year, it will go back as far as two years. DataSift allows for all sorts of data analysis because it pours all the tweets into a structured database. So you can give it queries like: “Give me all the tweets that mention TechCrunch from people who do not follow @techcrunch” or “All females in the UK who mention fashion.” The company is already collecting the 1 terabyte per day of data internally—that is how much is produced by the firehose of 250 million tweets a day— with 400 terabytes total so far. “This is a real ‘big data’ engine—and that we are making it simple—we are taking advantage of map reduce—but this is our own bespoke processing engine,” says DataSift founder Nick Halstead, referring to the Hadoop technology the service is partially based on.

Here’s how it works: You place a coin on the fish bone-shaped button on the top of the piggy bank, which alarms the small kitty that lives inside the savings box. It meows, opens the lid with its head, reaches out its paw, grabs the coin and moves back into the box with another meow. The battery-powered Itazura Bank is sized at W120mm×H115mm×D100mm and available in four versions: white kitty, brown kitty, white puppy and brown puppy. People living outside Japan can pre-order the money box over at the Japan Trend Shop for $31 . This video shows how the kitty steals coins:  Via Japan Trends

"Dish To Close Down More Blockbuster Stores Soon

 Finding a Blockbuster near you will become even harder in the near future. Dish Network Corp, which purchased the video-rental retail chain last year, made a statement Thursday saying more of the retail stores would be closing down in the U.S. than originally planned.  Dish, which immediately closed 10 percent of all Blockbuster video-rental stores but kept 90 percent of its employees, confirmed Thursday that unprofitable stores would be shuttered.  “We are committed to keeping the profitable stores open that are generating positive cash flow, but there are ones that aren’t going to make it,” Dish Network Chief Executive Joe Clayton told Reuters .  When Dish purchased the crumbling company in a bankruptcy auction last year for $320 million, one of its many goals was to offer a la carte cable —a  service that would allow subscribers to stream cable channels directly to their computer. With the on-sight of less than profitable stores across the country, Clayton confirmed that those stores that stayed open will begin selling Dish subscriptions and possibly offer customer support in the future.  “If a consumer has a problem, just bring your box in and we’ll give you a new one so you don’t have to stay at home and wait for an installation,” he said to Reuters.  How many stores the company plans to close has not been released, although spokesman Marc Lumpkin confirmed that decisions will be made on a “case by case” basis.  Photo via trebomb /Flickr

"In A World Of Tracks, Pink Floyd Fights For The Album

It has been suggested that the album is dead. That’s a bit hasty, I think; such an established musical tool can only be detonated when both the patron and the artist turn the key. What people are seeing is that the patrons (i.e. distributors and labels) have turned their key, and are now looking significantly at the artists, who aren’t quite sure yet. In fact, some are trying to talk the other guy down. Ever since Bach slipped some lesser-known works into a concert intended to gratify the public’s need for a saucy sarabande, the single has been the unit of promotion for larger musical works. Yet those larger works always remained distinct; the single was often a part of something larger, enjoyable as a whole or in its constituent parts to be sure, but the thing is there was a whole to speak of. That may not always be the case for much longer. As Nicholas notes, iTunes LP sales are pretty poor . Sure, they’ll look nice on an iPad and sure, having a good official version of the video is nice, but music is simply taking another tack these days, and a big premium package doesn’t fit. Digital distribution means the album is an eccentricity — to distributors. The thing is that not every artist is ready to change that — they call themselves artists for a reason, and to completely abandon the album is, I presume, for them like admitting they’re just making a product. Hey, depending on your opinion of a lot of the music out there today, you may or may not think that’s true already, but the artists are the ones making the music and it’s for them to decide when they’ll stop making albums. I’m sure there have been scuffles along these lines ever since iTunes became popular and contracts started getting renegotiated to accommodate 99-cent track downloads and such. In fact, it seems ridiculously late for Pink Floyd to jump down EMI’s throat about offering its tracks up for sale individually, which they claim is a breach of contract. EMI contends that that clause only applied to physical albums. It’s being hashed out as we speak, but it’s a fun little conflict, isn’t it? I’m rooting for Floyd. If they leave EMI after 40 years over this, I’d freak out. Probably not possible. Whether or not it’s a breach of Pink Floyd’s particular contract is immaterial in the end, though — the question is whether the artist should even have the ability to say “No – no singles, no individual tracks, no videos. Album only.” —or some variant thereof. I mean after all, almost all of Dark Side of the Moon flows one track into the other, to say nothing of albums from some of my favorite artists, from Sigur Ros to Deerhunter to Hotel Hotel. In fact, much of my favorite music has an album structure or concept — and I would argue that it’s because having that kind of concept indicates more care and craft taken with the music, more time and more planning. Shouldn’t they be able to say no to individual track availability, even at the cost of overall sales? But I digress; this isn’t a music blog. The question that will soon be answered is whether any artists will pull the trigger. There’s going to be a stigma to overcome (that of a mere songsmith) but when we’re already seeing iTunes exclusives and stuff like that, it doesn’t seem so far off. I support Pink Floyd and personally I wouldn’t want to buy their tracks one by one, but that’s a whole other era of music. Distributors are embracing the new system; how long can it be before artists start to do so as more than a fluke or experiment? Update:  They won! [image: Lost Highway Records ]

"Microsoft Says Windows Mobile Smartphones Are Great

Windows Mobile phones are still the way to go, according to Scott Rockfeld, group products manager for the mobile communications business at Microsoft. Despite all the ballyhoo surrounding the iPhone 3G launch, almost 20 million Windows Mobile licenses were sold for Microsoft’s fiscal year ending June 30. Microsoft’s visibility in the business sector has always been well noted, which Rockfeld pointed out in a recent interview . By citing strong security features and the ability to encrypt removable data storage cards, he noted it was predicted by IDC Corp to expect Windows Mobile phones to continue to outsell the iPhone 9:1 in business utilization. But for now, the point may be moot, as BlackBerry still remains the ubiquitous leader when it comes to business usage. Windows Mobile phones were purchased by seven out of ten largest companies in the world (as ranked by Fortune), while sales of at least 500 phones were tabulated at 325 different companies. Rockfeld criticized Apple’s decision to limit, at least for now, the number of developers who could create apps for the iPhone. He further noted that there are over 18,000 publicly available applications for Windows Mobile. By comparison, the Apple App Store has about 500. While the Microsoft/Apple war always seemed to center around business applications, it will be interesting to see how it shapes up in the mobile market. While Microsoft may have growing numbers to back it up, the mobile landscape is set to be redefined if Google’s ( sort of ) open-source Android platform takes off.

"Chrome Beta Update Lets You View All Open Tabs On Multiple Devices

 If you’re a Chrome Beta user, you’re in for a treat. Google’s beta version of its proprietary web browser just got an update that lets you view all your open tabs in Chrome across multiple devices.   Let’s say you’ve got Chrome Beta installed on your Macbook at home, a PC desktop at work, and your Android 4.0 smartphone. Now, if you open a tab on your Macbook, you’ll be able to view it on your work PC and smartphone. A new menu aptly named “Other devices” lets you view all the tabs open on all your different installs of the browser.  The update will roll out over the next few weeks. You must have the beta version of Chrome to use the feature; it’s not yet available for the stable build. Google uses Chrome Beta to test out new features like this before they go live. It’s free to download but is not always bug-free.  Likewise, to view tabs on your phone you must be running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, which is slowly rolling out to existing Android phones. If you’re running Ice Cream Sandwich, you can download Chrome Mobile Beta from the Google Play store.

"A Million App Downloads For Palm. A Million Iphone 3Gss For Apple.

“You know the beautiful thing: June 29, 2009, is the two- year anniversary of the first shipment of the iPhone,”  Elevation Partners (which owns a huge portion of Palm) co-founder Roger McNamee  told Bloomberg in March . “Not one of those people will still be using an iPhone a month later.” We’re 5 days away from that milestone. Anyone want to take that bet  still? It’s been 18 days since the launch of the Palm Pre, and the device has already passed an important milestone: 1 million app downloads , according to mobile analytics firm Medialets . That’s impressive for a store with only 30 or so applications. While Apple surpassed 10 million downloads in its first weekend following the App Store launch in 2007, it had over 500 applications at launch, and already had a few million devices (the original iPhone) with which people could download from. The big problem for Palm is that is set itself up to be compared to the iPhone with comments like the one above and its feature set . And now it has a huge mountain to climb to get anywhere near it. While the Pre may have seen a million app downloads after 18 days, Apple’s newest device, the iPhone 3GS, sold  a million hardware units in just three days after its launch last week. Analysts estimate Pre sales to be about 150,000 so far. All told, there are well over 20 million iPhones now out there (probably closer to 25 million), and when you throw in iPod touches (which also access the App Store), there are over 40 million units. And Palm isn’t making things any easier on itself . During this critical time after launch where new apps are vital, there are only 30 because the webOS SDK still isn’t open to all developers. Palm recently gave an update saying that developers should by the “end of this summer”, but even when they get it, it will likely be another few months before a wide range of apps start coming out. That means it will be the Fall or Winter before there are a ton of apps for the Pre — and that’s assuming developers jump on board. Meanwhile, all indications are that Apple’s new iPhone 3.0 SDK is kicking app development into an even higher level on that platform. The App Store is currently backlogged with app approvals, and just about every developer I’ve talked to, has something in the pipeline very shortly. Oh yeah, and Apple just launched a version of the iPhone that is $99, which everyone seems to be forgetting. The sales numbers on that should be interesting. That’s not to say Palm cannot be successful with the Pre and more specifically, its webOS, it can. It’s a great device, and a great platform. And the mobile arena, and specifically smartphones, are exploding in popularity right now. There is certainly more than enough room for a number of devices and a range of platforms. But Palm still has some very serious question marks on the business side of things, and they’re basically betting the farm on the Pre. It has another webOS device that may or may not come in the next few months, but even if it does, if the apps aren’t there, it could be facing a less than stellar entrance. And that’s the kind of performance Palm needs right now, stellar. On the other hand, McNamee’s comment might technically be true. All those people who bought the original iPhone may not be using one a month from now — they might be using the iPhone 3GS, instead. Let’s revisit this on July 29, shall we? [photo: flickr/ kowitz ]

"Kickstarter: Meet The Vers 1Q, A Stunning 2-Inch Battery-Powered Bluetooth Speaker

I’m in absolute love. From the gorgeous wood cabinet to the technical capabilities, the little Vers’ 1Q is simply perfect. The $120 price ( $99 for Kickstarters ) is just icing on the cake. It’s rather refreshing to see a warm, nearly alive device in our world that’s generally filled with modeled plastic and faux chrome trim. Simply put, the 1Q is a battery-powered Bluetooth speaker. A 2-inch driver provides the audio while, packed inside the walnut or bamboo casing, a 6.5W amp powers the audio provided from either Bluetooth or the 3.5mm jack. The included battery charges via microUSB and should last 10 hours on a charge. What more can you ask for from a small speaker? As shown by the pictures, the whole package is of a modest size. It fits in the hand, yet the creator brags that it “can easily deliver enough sound to fill some pretty large spaces.” Since it works with Bluetooth or an aux input, it should work with nearly every device. This isn’t Vers’ first consumer electronic device. The company already sells the Vers 1.5R radio/alarm , Vers 1E ear buds , and iPhone/iPad cases — all out of bamboo and walnut. The project is already funded on Kickstarter but they are still taking orders for 18 more days. Pledge $95 for a 1Q made out of either bamboo or walnut. Or, pledge an additional $30 for the limited edition red beech edition. Best yet the Vers promises these things will be delivered well before the holidays.

"Gumgum Announces Image Toolbar To Share Images With Built-In Ads

 GumGum wants to add value to every image on the internet. The startup announced a few months back that it can automate the process of putting ads into images on web sites . Today, it is unveiling a related feature called the Image Toolbar that lets users “socialize” an image by sharing it with firends on Facebook and Twitter.  The new feature, which has been in private beta testing for several months, lets users share an image with just one click. It also lets users view related images via a Google Image “like search,” which leverages GumGum’s ability to understand the context around a photo. The toolbar also lets users zoom in on photos. Links generated from the Image Toolbar point back to the publisher. Revenue generated by the toolbar is shared with publishers, said Ophir Tanz, co-founder of GumGum in Santa Monica, Calif.  The toolbar has already been widely adopted by more than 450 publisher sites, which is pretty impressive. It is generating 125 million impressions per month. Large partners include AskMen.com and several Internet Brands properties. Over time, the toolbar will be rolled out across GumGum’s billions of monthly image impressions. The primary purpose of the Image Toolbar is to drive additional page views and provide more value to users.  Tanz says that the company’s embed code for its images reaches 70 million monthly unique visitors across thousands of properties. The embed code identifies an image, assigns context to it, and overlays services on top of the images to maximize monetization and interaction. GumGum enables web publishers to make money from content on  their  sites. Since the ads become part of the photos, the publishers  don’t  have to set aside ad space on a web page to monetize the photos. The company was founded in early 2008 by Tanz and Ari Mir. It has 10 employees.  Rivals include PicApp, Image Space Media, and Pixazza. Tanz says his company is bigger than all of them. GumGum has raised $3.9 million in two rounds from First Round Capital, GRP Ventures, and Crosscut Ventures.

"Smac Stacks: What Every It Department Should Know

   var fm_ad_url = ""http://thirdparty.fmpub.net/placement/533818?fleur_de_sel=[timestamp]"";var fm_timestamp = new Date().getTime();fm_ad_url = fm_ad_url.replace( ""[timestamp]"", fm_timestamp );document.write( ""<script type='text/javascript' src='"" + fm_ad_url + ""'><\/script>"" );  This post is brought to you by Cognizant. To learn more visit cognizant.com/smac . As always, VentureBeat is adamant about maintaining editorial objectivity.   There’s a new acronym in town — and it’s a fun one: SMAC!  Standing for Social, Mobile, Analytics (based on big data), and Cloud, SMAC describes a new type of product and service combo that many new and existing companies are adopting to deliver effective and agile customer experiences. And remaining competitive in certain sectors — like IT or media distribution — may depend on it.  Want an easy way to visualize a so-called SMAC stack? Look no further than Netflix . The movie/entertainment game-changer uses advanced analytics and elaborate algorithms to recommend films tailored to you. It then streams media from the cloud and allows you to view it seamlessly on multiple platforms — your television, your tablet, your phone, etc. And after all that, you have the option to share your thoughts with your social graph.  What distinguishes a SMAC stack is that all of these components work together as an ecosystem. New features aren’t haphazardly “bolted on.” Instead, mobile capabilities drive even richer data collection that can be used to delve deeper into the cloud, engage social channels and give customers increasingly personalized experiences.  iTunes is another easy example to digest. Analytics serve up choices based on users’ prior experiences, it allows quick and easy downloads from the cloud, and media can be accessed and enjoyed from a variety of mobile devices. Apple developed iTunes Ping as an internal social network/recommender service, but it was recently scrapped in favor of plain old Twitter and Facebook integration.  That last point is telling because the injection of social into mobile/analytics/cloud infrastructures has really been the catalyst for the popularity of the SMAC approach. Social isn’t simply a new innovation or service to bake into a product. It’s a whole mode of behavior, redefining the way we engage with almost all digital services and each other.  A really good illustration of this is Oracle’s adoption of the SMAC stack . In October 2011, the enterprise software and database management giant launched the Oracle Social Network. Inspired by the momentum of Facebook, this service gives companies and industry networks the infrastructure to build and run their own social networks and facilitate communication.  For instance, in the health industry it’s imperative that researchers, clinicians, physicians, drug developers, academics, regulators and patients all have the ability to communicate and share knowledge. That’s how innovation happens. All of this data exists in the cloud where analytics are used to forge connections and move things forward. And moreover, all the people involved can access the info they need from anywhere — whether it’s the computer in their office or their smartphone from a field clinic in Kenya.  The SMAC approach in this case became so important to Oracle that it purchased a health-oriented data management software company called Phase Forward . Along with it, it got mechanisms for everyone from researchers to patients to securely and efficiently share, view and contribute to the same pools of data. The buy propelled Oracle from No. 1 to No. 3 in the healthcare software space. As of earlier this year, the software had been used in more than 10,000 clinical trials for new drug development.  It’s clear that SMAC stacks pack a lot of power. Each of their components are increasingly well-known and even expected. More and more, consumers are confused when they aren’t presented with social integration or mobile capabilities. And, working in concert, the cloud, analytics, social and mobile only drive further innovation in each of these areas.  So, what does this mean for enterprise IT departments?  While it’s true that IT departments everywhere would be well-advised to adopt the SMAC approach as soon as possible, the resources that come along with SMAC stacks will actually make their jobs easier and maximize their capabilities.  Already, modern IT departments are tasked with bringing together and maintaining scattered, disparate platforms, networks and equipment to give internal and external customers what they want. This isn’t new, and it’s long kept IT departments from responding as quickly, securely or nimbly as they’d like. Let’s say that 100 new employees all need their own personalized computing resources requiring different software and functionality. This used to be a serious undertaking.  Now, mobility and cloud computing in particular have made consistent, scalable solutions possible across multiple types of platforms. Because cloud-based software doesn’t have to be tailored for specific operating systems, it works for anyone. And mobile access allows people to access and accomplish work as easily from their phones as from their desks.  Mobile in particular has evolved tremendously to make this happen. This is one area where IT departments or their contractors are needing to invest in creating mobile experiences and applications that are easy to navigate and use. It’s not just about making websites or data appear correctly on handsets or tablets, it’s about designing and implementing products tailored specifically to mobile devices. Once these products and services exist, they have the potential to revolutionize productivity.  This doesn’t mean that social and analytics infrastructure should take a back seat though. IT departments can leverage interactions on social channels to respond more quickly to concerns, stay in touch with what people want and need, and deliver superior service. Internal social networks for companies are becoming increasingly popular with platforms from companies like Oracle, Yammer and SalesForce (specifically its Chatter tool) for this very reason.  Very similarly, analytics can be collected through a variety of channels, from social sites to transactions to filed tickets. IT departments can parse this big data to determine what needs to be improved company-wide, which issues are the most pressing, and how people are best taught and helped on a macro level. Also, with so many more end points out in the world with every employee carrying their own company laptop and cell phone, analytics can help calculate risk exposure so that potential issues can be headed off at the pass.  Taken together, SMAC resources can make IT operations leaner, faster and smarter. It’s something that a number of companies big and small have already discovered and enthusiastically embraced. What will be most interesting is how the approach will evolve we learn more about social, mobile, analytics and the cloud can be optimized.  That’s the beauty of the SMAC approach after all. Each component deepens understanding of the others, making for an increasingly powerful, long-term strategy.

"Boardrounds Helps Hospitals Follow Up With Patients After They Leave The Emergency Room

BoardRounds is a startup helping hospitals stay connected with patients after they leave the emergency room — co-founder and CEO Benjamin Jack said the approach is “much like Google Now, but for healthcare.” Jack comes from the medical world — he recently received his M.D. from Cornell . He told me via email that normally, when a patient leaves the emergency room, they’re given a phone number to arrange for follow-up care, but “most patients don’t call, don’t get the follow-up they need, get sicker, and return to the emergency room which strains hospital and health insurer resources.” So what’s the deal with Google Now comparison? Jack means that when hospitals and doctors use BoardRounds , the app will automate the follow-up process, delivering “just-in-time recommendations for patients.” So it can help with scheduling follow-up appointments, arranging transportation to those appointments, and also setting up home care. Jack said the company combines automation with live support. It offers analytics too, for example telling doctors how many patients actually completed their follow-on appointments. And it’s working with medical service providers to connect patients with follow-on care — for example, it has partnered with Atlantic Dialysis. Today, the startup is announcing that it’s backed by the Dorm Room Fund , the First Round Capital investment arm that’s run by and investing in college students. ( The fund normally offers around $20,000 in funding to startups , as well as mentorship.) Other investors include Greg Pass, Twitter’s first CTO and now chief entrepreneurial officer at Cornell Tech, as well as Thatcher Bell, Managing Director at Gotham Ventures.

"What Boards Of Directors Can Learn From The Supreme Court

 (Editor’s note: Brad Feld is a n early stage investor and co-founder of Foundry Group. This post originally appeared on his blog .)  I had an incredible experience this week.  My friend Phil Weiser, who is now the Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the US Department of Justice, Antitrust Division (I prefer to call him America’s Top Cop on Agriculture) invited me, my partner Jason Mendelson, and my wife Amy Batchelor to attend the Supreme Court Oral Arguments for re Bilski .  For those that know about my fervent anti-patent bias with regards to software , Bilski is an important case.  Depending on how the Supreme Court rules, it could open the door for both the invalidation of business method patents as well as begin a serious discussion about the validity of software patents.  One can hope.  So, this wasn’t a random Supreme Court visit, but rather one that is highly relevant to something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking, talking and writing about.  At exactly 1pm, the Justices entered, sat and immediately called the Petitioner (J. Michael Jakes).  Jakes got about thirty seconds into his oral argument when Justice Scalia jumped in with a question.  A short answer by Jakes was followed by a question by Breyer.  Another short answer and then a question by Ginsburg.  Then Breyer. Then Sotomayor.  Within five minutes I was stunned at the high level of understanding the Justices had in this particular case, the insightfulness of their questions, and their level of participation.  Breyer, Roberts, Scalia, and Sotomayor continued to question the petitioner for the next five minutes.  Their tone was aggressive – bordering on hostile – but never quite crossing the line.  The Petitioner abruptly finished (reserving the balance of his time) and the Respondent (Malcolm L. Stewart) began.  It was a similar drill and it continued for about 30 minutes – followed by a four-minute rebuttal from the Petitioner.  The experience continued to bounce around in the back of my mind the next day.  I was at a board meeting for a company that I’ve been on the board of for almost a decade – and it turned out to be the most productive meeting we’ve had in a long time.  I’ve written about The Best Board Meetings  in the past.  One element of those is a prepared mind .  This is the powerful lesson I learned from the Supreme Court.  I saw 11 very smart people at the Court participate in a very complex discussion that they were extremely prepared for.  In one hour they covered an amazing amount of ground, due to the work they did in advance of the meeting.  In many board meetings, the material shows up at the meeting. Sometimes, it arrives in advance, but the board members haven’t read it. And all too often the board material is either not detailed enough or is too detailed.  Basically, either the board members don’t have sufficient material to have a prepared mind in advance of the meeting, or they don’t take the time to do the work to be prepared.  So unlike the Supreme Court session, where you can dive into substance immediately, the board members and management spend a long portion of the meeting “getting up to speed”.  It’s a total waste of time for everyone in the room.  In my meeting, everyone was prepared.  The material was comprehensive, but not overly so.  It came in advance of the meeting (only 24 hours, but still enough time for everyone to read it).  And, rather than go through the material page by page, we picked a handful of key themes and discussed them… for several hours… in detail, but at a level that resulted in clarity for the board members and management.  The other key lesson I learned at the Supreme Court is the value of paying attention .  I’ve written about this also in VC Behavior in Board Meetings . I continue to fall victim to the blackberry-checking syndrome.  Phones, computers, and PDAs aren’t allowed in the Supreme Court – so I paid attention.  And, as a result, I really followed what was going on and processed almost all of the information.  In the board meeting, I found myself drifting a little and pulling out my iPhone.  It detracted from the meeting, but most importantly it caused me to likely miss a few things I shouldn’t have missed.  Concentration is a hard thing to achieve – but it’s the best way to make an informed, rational decision. You never know what detail will matter.

"Mcafee: Cybercrime-As-A-Service Led To Credit Card Breach, While Mobile “Malware Zoo” Grew 197% In Q4

It looks like the rise of the “as a service” model, where people can buy software, platform access, security and more from a cloud-based provider for a fixed term, may have spawned its Damien : cybercrime as a service. The latest report from McAfee notes that the rush of point-of-sale credit card breaches that hit consumers in Q4 of last year — most notably at Target but other retailers as well — came from such sources, with the malware used “likely purchased ‘off the shelf’ from the Cybercrime-as-a-Service community” (one example illustrated above). McAfee also provided an update on the state of mobile malware — which it refers to as a “malware zoo”. It is showing little sign of abating, up 197% over the same quarter a year ago. McAfee’s conclusions on the credit card breach paint a depressing picture for what is on offer for those who are intent on such thefts in the future. Although these were perhaps the biggest credit card breaches yet, and actually occurred at point-of-sale locations rather than online, the web had a big part to play, regardless. “What is even more notable is how well the malware industry served its customers,” Vincent Weafer, SVP of McAfee Labs, writes. After purchasing off-the-shelf point-of-sale malware online (in Target’s case, it was called BlackPOS), the malicious hackers modified it specifically for their purposes. Working with different agencies, McAfee says that it was able to identify the coding used both to extract different data (domain names, user accounts, etc.) as well as the code that fed that data back to the hackers (respectively shown below): “They even had a ready and efficient black market for selling the stolen credit card information, including an anonymous, virtual-currency-based point-of-sale payment system. Raw materials, manufacturing, marketplace, transaction support—it’s all there for thieves to use,” he writes. McAfee estimates that the credit card data — reportedly 40 million credit card numbers reported stolen — is being sold in batches of 1 million-4 million on marketplaces like Lampeduza Republic . Other notable points in the McAfee report: — Malicious signed binaries are on the rise. McAfee says that the growth of “dubious” content distribution networks — or the abuse of legitimate ones — is seeing a big spike in certificate authorities (aka CA — used to make secure connections over the internet) being piggybacked by malicious applications. In Q4, it says it found over 2.3 million new and unique malicious signed binaries, a 52% increase over Q3. The number discovered in 2013 — around 5.7 million — was more than three times the number discovered in 2012. “This threat is not only expanding ever more rapidly, but it is also becoming more complex,” McAfee writes. In total there were more than 8 million malicious signed binaries in 2013 — throwing into question the safety of the CA model. — Mobile malware. This continues to climb, with 2.47 million new samples collected in 2014, and 744,000 in Q4 alone, rising 197% compared to a year ago. McAfee doesn’t single out a specific platform, but Android — as the world’s most popular smartphone platform, has been pinpointed by others as a particular target. What’s interesting is that while the whole year is up on 2012, the biggest spike of all was actually a year ago: McAfee notes that mobile malware is finding its way to devices in much the same way as other platforms like PCs — through apps, through browsing online and so on. It also notes that its compiled a list of apps in a “reputation database” that tracks how much information they pull from users and how that increases their privacy riskiness. And just as they guessed, it turned out that of the top 10 in that list, six contained malware. (We’re trying to see if they will share the top 10 list with us.) — Malware increase. McAfee tracked 200 new malware samples every minute in 2013. — North America still tops the list for dodgy content. Despite the rise of certain countries as hotbeds of malicious hackers, the U.S. is still topping McAfee’s list for hosting suspicious content and spam URLs. (U-S-A!) — Overall, browser attacks remain the most-common route for malicious hacking.

 Mozilla developer Nicholas Nethercote is taking steps to make PDFs in Firefox slimmer.  Earlier this year, Nethercote optimized the PDF viewing process for Firefox with pdf.js , a new PDF viewer that uses HTML canvas elements to render each PDF page. Those “canvas” elements can be millions of pixels in size.  While Nethercote’s enchancements greatly improved rendering on Linux, the changes left PDF viewing slow for OS X users. The reason for this, Nethercote says, is that Firefox on Linux doesn’t store this kind of data within the Firefox process, but Firefox for Mac does.  He’s applied four patches to the problem, and now pdf.js caches fewer canvases and can dispose of the excess. So far, the patches are live in the master pdf.js repository, and they’ll be integrated into Firefox code in time for the release of Firefox 33 in mid-October.

"How Can Local Businesses Avoid The Horror And Structure More Effective Daily Deals?

Couponing has been around forever, but the popularity of digital offers, daily deals, and group buying is fairly new. We’ve gone through the honeymoon period, watched the meteoric rise of Groupon, its overvaluation, IPO — and thankfully, through it all, we’ve seen increasing scrutiny on the space, especially over just how profitable daily deals actually are for local businesses. The debate has raged over the daily deal model’s clever repackaging of old ideas and just how valuable the Groupon model is as an advertising mechanism for local merchants. Rocky was probably a little overzealous in saying that Groupon is poised for collapse , but there is no doubt that there are holes in its business model , just as there is no doubt that there are upsides to the model as a whole , both as an advertising channel and a tool for customer acquisition and retention. In the end the scrutiny is essential, just as it is to find a middle ground — falling into the extremes of “daily deals are the best!” or “the daily deal industry needs to die!” misses the point that offers and daily deals can work, but only if they’re structured correctly. Otherwise, they can go wrong and go wrong quickly. As Arash pointed out in his post this summer, the horror stories over daily deals often come from merchants who negotiate poor deal terms, don’t track redemption or customer spend, and don’t understand the economics of running a daily deal. Dr. Dholakia’s thorough analysis puts some numbers to the current flux in the daily deal industry, pointing out that 72.8 percent of merchants indicated openness to considering a different daily deal site. Merchants are open to trying your site’s model if you can prove that you have their best interest in mind and can structure deals that can help them retain customers and offer them more than a simple 50/50 split of profits. That’s how they can differentiate their value propositions. There may not be a cure-all model, but for the space to remain healthy going forward, it’s important to pose some prescriptions for merchants on how to structure daily deals so that they can get the most out of them. It’s an important conversation to have, and I hope you’ll weigh in. The Dealmix , a new daily deal aggregator and deal map founded by former Googlers to bring “a bit of organization and simplicity to the wild and wooly deal market”, has created an infographic for local businesses on how to design profitable deals and make them work. Check it out and let us hear your feedback. Let’s make this industry better.

"Nes Controller Turned Slvr Case

 Yeah. Chicks are gonna love it. Old school NES controllers can take a beating. I remember playing the living hell out of Contra and Super C trying to beat them for hours on end, only to find myself throwing an NES controller as hard as I could on the floor. Seems this gentleman with the goofy burger hat had the same revelation and decided to turn the obsolete controller into a sturdy cellphone case. Looks like the dude took a lighter or Dremel and cut out a section for his SLVR’s display and buttons. Too bad that the SLVR already makes you look like a fool. This just adds insult to injury.

"Dragon'S Lair Coming To Blu-Ray

When the word “Laserdisc” comes to mind, I think of three things: Dragon’s Lair , Space Ace , and failed technology. Luckily, nostalgic fans of the animated Dragon’s Lair will be excited to know that it will be coming back in the form of a Blu-ray disc. Come April 9th, you’ll be able to leap over pits, fight dragons, and walk through dark corridors in HD with 5.1 surround sound. A company called Digital Leisure will be releasing the game totally redone and retouched on Blu-ray, targeting PS3 owners for sure. And just as you expected, Space Ace and Dragon’s Lair II: Time Warp will be released on Blu-ray in the future as well. Why kill off a few dying titles when you can just re-release them whenever a new movie format comes out? Ahh, genius. Dragon’s Lair revamped for Blu-ray play [Reg Hardware]

"The Fcc Is Making Emergency Alerts Longer… And Adding Links

 You may start to get longer, more detailed messages in the future from the government or law enforcement when danger is afoot.  The Federal Communications Commission voted today to change rules related to its Wireless Emergency Alerts system (WEA).  The WEA was used earlier this month to send a message to millions when law enforcement was searching for Ahmad Khan Rahami, the alleged terrorist who is accused of planting bombs in parts of New York and New Jersey. It was one of the first times the system was used in a manhunt .  Previously limited to 90 characters, emergency alerts can now be 360 characters. Links that contain maps, photos, or phone numbers other than 911 can also be sent after the change to WEA policy. The update to WEA policy was also made to allow local and state officials to use the emergency alert system more often. Wireless carriers must support links shared in emergency alerts within one year.  They also have to improve geographic targeting, provide messages in Spanish, and explore providing alerts in other languages in the future.  Nationwide, more than 21,000 have been sent since WEA was launched in 2012, said Rear Admiral David Simpson, who runs the Public Safety and Homeland Security bureau of the FCC. Speaking before the commission today, Simpson said the limitations of WEA were made clear in recent events.  Rahami was spotted and arrested hours after the alert was sent, but New York officials told the FCC it would have been more effective with a photo. In Baton Rouge, flood victims received an emergency alert, but poor geographic targeting led some typically outside the flood plain to ignore the message.  “Now that stakeholders have four years’ experience with the service, and in light of its real-world use and technological advancements since the FCC adopted technical and procedural requirements for WEA in 2008, the agency has updated its rules,” the commission said in a statement .  Emergency alerts are sent by authorities during a life-threatening event like severe weather or lethal criminal activity. Alerts can also be sent by the President of the United States if he or she chooses to do so, and in the event that a child is abducted and an Amber Alert is issued. A smartphone user can choose to block WEAs, except those that come from the President.  The FCC also created a new class of alert. Public safety alerts can be sent to provide emergency shelter locations, or if a water boil order is issued.  The bombings in New York and New Jersey was an example of WEA’s power and its limitations, said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who used to live blocks from where a bomb went off in Brooklyn.  “We also expanded testing opportunities for state and local officials, but we should not stop here, because the episode in my old neighborhood did more than burn or damage a building. It demonstrated that, going forward, we can do more with these messages. Vague directives and text about where to find more information about a suspect just as we saw in New York are not good enough,” she said. “As we move into the 5G future, we need to make sure that multimedia is available in all of our alert messages.”

"Vr Audio Startup Dysonics Closes Series A Led By Intel Capital

If you had the chance to watch the second episode of the new season of Black Mirror, you won’t take much convincing when people tell you how important realistic 3D audio is to immersing you in a virtual reality/mixed reality experience. Dysonics is a startup in the VR audio space looking to build the hardware and software workflows that give VR content creators high-fidelity solutions to bringing top-notch audio into their content. Today, the company closed a Series A investment led by Intel Capital with participation from Rawah Partners.The investment was shared as part of a broader Intel Capital announcement disclosing $38 million in new investments across 12 frontier tech companies including Dysonics. The amount of funding for this specific investment not disclosed. The company had previously raised a $750k seed round in 2012 from Rawah to get the company up and running. Dysonics has a few products out right now, including a head-tracking system called RondoMotion, aimed at bringing head-tracked 360 audio to regular headphones and RondoMic, a high-fidelity all-in-one microphone array capture system. Right now, the company is working with LA-based Radiant Images to handle rentals of the RondoMic. The RondoMic is definitely a product geared towards professional use. First off, the thing is the size of a watermelon and has a carbon fiber shell so it’s pretty apparent that this device means serious business. The RondoMic utilizes eight custom Telefunken M60 FET microphones (the high-end mics retail for about $600 a pop). Dysonics CTO Bob Dalton estimates the RondoMic could likely sell for something above $10,000, but specified that the company largely intends to focus on rentals with this particular version. As Dysonics grows, Dalton tells me it’s looking to looking to grow its market potential outside of solely focusing on high-end professional users and embrace the high-end consumer markets with devices that come in different shapes and sizes but still produce compelling high-quality 360 audio capture. Virtual reality audio is a bit of a wild space at the moment. Despite major presences from established audio giants like Sennheiser and Dolby, there really haven’t been too many standards established. With the high-end high-fidelity hardware the company is making, it would be easy to frame Dysonics as hardware company, but Dalton is weary with that classification. The real growth potential for the company is with its end-to-end VR audio solution. Rondo360 is an application and set of plug-ins that works across digital audio workstations to process binaural audio and make handling 360 audio much more seamless. The system is agnostic to your channel configurations or hardware, meaning it plays nice with most people’s go-to setups. “The world of VR audio is pretty fragmented at the moment,” Dalton told me. “The market is kind of open to new solutions that can solve a lot of these problems in terms of the overall fidelity, the realism of the experience, the distribution of the content and the performance on the playback side.”

"Mg’S 10 Favorite Iphone Games Of 2008

 Yesterday, I wrote up my 10 favorite iPhone apps of 2008 with a note that I wasn’t including any games on the list because there were far too many good ones and they should probably get their own list. Today, I bring you that list.  This was a tough one to narrow down to 10, I have nearly 40 games that I keep on my iPhone right now, and I wouldn’t keep anything on there that I don’t enjoy playing. Just as with yesterday’s list, it’s important to note that these are my 10 favorite games on the iPhone and not necessarily what I think are the 10 best , because that’s something that’s simply too hard to rate with so many different kinds of games out there in the App Store.  I think it’s also worth noting that while on yesterday’s app list almost all of the apps I chose were free, on the games list only one of them (Aurora Feint) is really free — and it was just free to get users addicted so they could release paid sequels. Half of the games on this list are $4.99 or over, which once again says to me that there’s a future for higher priced quality apps in the App Store .  Counting down:  10. Booty Blocks — A recently released game in the vein of Tetris, although I like it more than actual Tetris for the iPhone because it’s a bit different and has some flare. The game’s pirate theme (hence the “booty” in the title) makes for some nice graphics and a fun musical score. Booty Blocks also allows you to use the iPhone’s touch screen and accelerometer to move pieces around. You can even move them after they’ve been placed. The game is $1.99. [ iTunes Link ]  9. Pop — When the App Store first launched over the summer, a few developers came out with games that simply involved popping bubbles on the screen. Those were fun for about 10 minutes. Pop takes what was fun about those games and turns it into a real game, with strategy. You are still trying to pop bubbles, but you’re doing so in a set period of time and there are certain bubbles you want to pop more than others. It’s very addicting. The game is $4.99, but there’s also a lite version , which is free. [ iTunes Link ]  8. Fieldrunners — It’s a tower defense game for the iPhone, but it has better graphics than its main competitor, TapDefense. Of course, TapDefense is free, while Fieldrunners is $4.99, but Fieldrunners is more addicting to me because it plays a bit faster as well. Still, when I sit down to play it, I find it hard to stop in under 30 minutes. The upcoming version 1.2 from developers Subatomic Studios also promises new towers. The game is $4.99. [ iTunes Link ]  7. Tap Tap Dance — It’s a tough call whether to include Tap Tap Revenge or Tap Tap Dance, but I went with the latter simply because while I think Tap Tap Revenge is a pretty nice Guitar Hero port for the iPhone, Tap Tap Dance is more like Dance Dance Revolution, but different because you use your hands and the iPhone’s accelerometer. The music, from the likes of Daft Punk and The Chemical Brother is good and make this game very addicting. The game is $4.99. [ iTunes Link ]  6. Aurora Feint: The Beginning — This was probably the first iPhone game that I was really addicted to . It’s a puzzle game not unlike Tetris, but it adds in an element of a role playing. As you progress through levels, you buy power-ups and new equipment to help you in later rounds. The game also smartly uses the accelerometer, making you rotate the device to break certain blocks ups. (The developers have also since released a few sequels .) The game is free. [ iTunes Link ]  5. I Love Katamari — It may surprise some people to see this game on the list because there were some serious bugs that hampered gameplay when Namco first launched the game on the iPhone. But I’m happy to report that those have all been ironed out with an update and now the game runs very smoothly. A game like Katamari just seems perfect for the iPhone and iPod touch with their accelerometers, so I’m glad it works now. The game is $7.99. [ iTunes Link ]  4. Enigmo — The first game I actually paid money for on the iPhone that I still play to this day. I like it because it reminds me of the classic game Lemmings, but it’s different because it’s all about using the iPhone’s touch screen to manipulate drops of water (and sometimes fire) to reach their endpoint goals. The game is currently $1.99 — which is a good deal because I paid $9.99 for it back when it was released. [ iTunes Link ]  3. SimCity — It’s another game with bugs (there are some serious load time issues ), but when you get past those, it’s pretty remarkable how well EA was able to take a pretty complex game, basically SimCity 3000, and put it on the iPhone. It’s just as much of a time suck on the iPhone as it was on the computer — I’ve sat down and played it for several hours at a time without realizing it. And once you get used to the touch controls, it’s amazing how well they work. The game is $9.99. [ iTunes Link ]  2. Frenzic — There may not be a more addicting original game on the iPhone. The key to Frenzic is that it’s fast-paced — if you think it’s really easy at first, just wait till you progress. While the game isn’t as complex as some of the others on this list, it’s the one game I turn to if I have a few minutes to kill and want to play something really quick. Plus the game is only $1.99 right now — a must-buy. [ iTunes Link ]  1. Rolando — I’ve already written about why I think it’s the first truly great iPhone game , and based on the amount of press coverage and praise it’s gotten, I’m sure many of you agree now. Rolando is a great game because it was built to use all of the things the iPhone and iPod touch have to offer . It uses the touch screen, multi-touch, the accelerometer and has the great iSave feature which lets you exit the game at any point and have your position saved just in case you get, you know, a call, on what is after all your cell phone. Rolando will be the proof that well crafted, iPhone-specific higher-priced games can succeed. It sets a new standard. The game is $9.99. [ iTunes Link ]  Honorable Mentions: Amateur Surgeon, Antimatter, BurnBall, Centipede, Dactyl, de Blob, Deep Green, Dizzy Bee (1 and 2), Dr. Awesome, Lego Batman, Maze Finger, Monopoly, Scrabble, Sudoku, Topple and Trace.

"Pingpad Launches Mobile-Centric Tools For Group Collaboration

Ross Mayfield said that at his new startup Pingpad , “We’re trying to build the next great productivity app.” Mayfield previously worked as director of business development at LinkedIn and co-founded collaboration company Socialtext . He created Pingpad with his wife Leila Al-Shamari — in fact, they said the idea first came to them when they were planning for their wedding, and they were struck by the lack of good options for planning together. (Other co-founders include Pete Kaminski and David Spector .) To use Pingpad, users create groups, then they can share notes and lists within those groups, send messages, and create tasks and assignments. None of that might seem particularly groundbreaking, but Mayfield said the aim is to create a platform for all the things you need to “get things done as a group together.” That means Pingpad is designed around groups, rather than, say, shared documents. It could also mean the company will add more applications in the future. And yes, there are plenty of collaboration tools out there, but in Mayfield’s view, most of them aren’t really designed for mobile, or they’re focused on a specific aspect of collaboration, like messaging. “I’m supporting the needs of an individual in all the facets of their identity, in the groups that they get things done with,” Mayfield added. The service is currently available for free. The plan, eventually, is to charge for premium features. “People will pay us a little bit of money to be more socially productive.” The startup has raised more than $1 million from investors including Floodgate, 500 Startups, CrunchFund and Greylock. (Like TechCrunch, CrunchFund was founded by Michael Arrington, and it’s backed by TechCrunch-owner AOL.)

"Back To School: Cameras

So this is your first year of real independence and trust me, you’ll want to document every possible thing. That’s probably one thing I failed to do during my collegiate days. Girls making out and possibly showing you their hooha’s are something you’ll want to hold onto while at college. You never know when you’re going to need to blackmail said hooha to get test answers. And I know some of you are strapped for cash, so we’ll check out a couple point-and-shoots, DSLRs and maybe a video camera or two. For some reason a lot of my friends have really old point-and-shoots that are the size of…well, really big mofos. You might be in the same boat, so why not get something that catches everyone’s eye and will certainly make him or her your next subject. Enter the Fuji Finepix Z20fd . It boasts an ISO of 1600 for those oh so important low light girl-on-girl make out sessions, face detection and auto red-eye correction. There’s even a handy one-touch movie recording for fast uploads to Youtube. You can get it for as low as $147.95 . If you’re a trust fund baby then take a gander at the Panasonic Lumix LX3 . It’s equipped with a 24mm F2.0 Leica lens. ‘Nough said. Well worth the $500 price tag and my brother really wants one. He owns, like, 20 cameras, so I trust his judgement. So you’re over the point-and-shoot shenanigans and you’re ready to step up to a real camera are you? Good to hear. You just put a smile on my face and the face of SLR manufacturers the world over. First up is the Olympus E-420 . This thing is tiny weighing in at 13.4 ounces but powerful. It’s a pretty good entry-level DSLR that’s easy to use. I had a chance to demo this and the E-520 last week at the US Open and images came out surprisingly well or maybe I’m just that damned good. I can’t stress to you how tiny these DSLRs are, so they’re perfect to tote around campus and parties. But it all depends on your skill level. Either are great choices for only $530 and $700 , respectively. If you’re looking for an even beefier setup with all the features you might find in a more expensive package then take a look at the Pentax K200D . I don’t condone the mistreatment of gadgets, but the K200D was overhauled with all new weather sealing so some side spray from the beer bong (serious water sports enthusiasts should check out the Pentax W60 or the Olympus 1040 or 1050 with the latter being shock resistant as well) likely won’t render it useless. The 18-55mm kit lens covers the basic focal lengths needed by youngsters like yourself unless you plan on perving out in the alley of the Kappa Kappa Gamma house. Alternatively you can find the older K100D Super for much cheaper than the $620 you’ll dish out for the K200D. The latest Rebel from Canon, the XS isn’t a shabby competitor in this arena either and it has live view as does the Olympus. It all comes down to personal preference and which UI you feel most comfortable with. The Pentax is pretty straight forward, but that might come from having used one for the last few years. The Olympus takes a bit of extra time to figure out, but it’s not the science of the rockets by any means. I can’t personally attest to the ease of use on the Canon XS, but I’m sure it’s not too difficult based on my experience with previous generations. You can snag one for $700 . More of a cinematographer are you? How about the Samsung MX20 ? It is, after all, Youtube ready and comes in at $280. Or you can just go with that Flip thing we reviewed a while back. Well, kids, that should do you some good this year. Have fun and send us some of those girl-on-girl pics. Heh. JK.

"Estimote Details Ios 7 Ibeacon Support For Its Contextual Proximity Shopping Devices

Estimote, a Y Combinator graduate and Hardware Alley exhibitor here at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2013, was able to talk about something today that it’s never been able to before: how its product will work with Apple’s new iBeacon tech in iOS 7. iBeacons allow developers to communicate with iOS devices via Bluetooth Low Energy, in order to provide them with contextual info based on their immediate surroundings. Back in July, John Biggs wrote about Estimote and its initial product , which is essentially a rock-shaped device which uses Bluetooth low energy to allow a retailer to do things like communicate deals to shoppers based on which aisle they’re in, for instance, or by letting them even send a payment token from a smartphone, with variable proximity programmable by the retailer, so you could either tap to pay or just get close to a terminal. The tech was impressive enough as it is, but now that Apple has introduced iOS 7 and made its iBeacons feature official, Estimote’s Chris Waclawek explained that it’ll be much, much easier for companies to build software for iOS devices that can work with Estimote in a variety of ways. The company plans to make a variety of different kinds of hardware that can take advantage of iBeacon, to make things like abandoned shopping cart follow-up a realistic and easy-to-implement possibility for brick and mortar stores. This would work by allowing retailers to detect how long they’re spending in fitting rooms, for instance, so that they can tell when a shopper has spent say 20 minutes trying something on, and then walked out without purchasing that item. They could then follow-up with a specific coupon for that article, allowing them to try to complete a sale that otherwise would’ve definitely been beyond reach. Waclawek explained that Apple’s decision to embrace Bluetooth LE for these kinds of uses by developers means that NFC and QR codes are definitely dead at this point, since Bluetooth allows for much greater range and doesn’t require combining with any other tech for handshaking or anything else. He’s clearly excited by the prospects now that iBeacons is out and developers will have access to the tech.

"At&T Adds Five New Android Phones To Their Lineup

If you thought that AT&T’s Android lineup was a bit lacking, then today’s announcement just may change your mind. AT&T has pulled back the curtains on a fleet of five new Android-powered smartphones that should hit wireless retailers just in time for all that holiday commotion. The new Samsung Captivate Glide may bear a resemblance to its distant cousins the Stratosphere and the Epic 4G, but the similarities are purely cosmetic. While this Gingerbread handset packs a similar 4-inch Super AMOLED display, it also has a dual-core 1GHz Nvidia Tegra 2 processor under the hood and 1GB of RAM to help keep things running smoothly. As you can tell, it also sports a comfortable-looking four row keyboard, but perhaps less obvious are the HSPA+ radio, an 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 1.3-megapixel frontfacer. Motorola’s Atrix 2 actually seems like a mixed bag as far as upgrades go. It rocks a sleeker body than its predecessor, not to mention an new HSPA+ radio so users can finally push the limits of AT&T’s Faux-G network. An unnamed 1GHz dual-core processor is calling the shots, which is a bit odd considering how proud they were of the original’s Tegra 2 chipset, and the display has been bumped up to 4.3 inches without a similar bump in resolution. That bit of stretching means that the Atrix 2 is working with a slightly lower pixel density than the original model, which may be a disappointment for current Atrix fans. It indeed runs Gingerbread, and an 8-megapixel camera capable of shooting 1080p video rounds out the package. These two are the new heavyweight additions to AT&T’s portfolio, but let’s not forget the company’s new mid-and-low-range options. Pantech joins the fray here with their Gingerbread-powered Pocket. It follows some of the design language used in some of Pantech’s other phones, which is my polite way of saying that it’s awfully squarish. It’s got a 4-inch SVGA display, a 2GB microSD card, and a 5 megapixel rear camera. The Pocket lives up to its namesake by squeezing everything into a slim frame that’s only 11.3mm thick, so even the skinny jeans fans among you shouldn’t have too much trouble toting this thing around. The Samsung DoubleTime gains the dubious distinction of being the only phone here to be stuck with Android 2.2/FroYo. Really? Even the ZTE gets Gingerbread? In any case, the DoubleTime’s big gimmicks are its flip-open design and the internal and external touchscreens mounted on either side of the top half. It rocks a 600MHz Qualcomm processor, comes with a 2 GB microSD card, and will only be available in white with pink trim. The AT&T Avail, made by ZTE, is the company’s second prepaid Android device. It’s pretty blase as far as smartphones go: it features a 3.5-inch touchscreen, and a 5 megapixel camera. That’s it. It seems like even AT&T is having trouble getting excited over this thing but in fairness, it’s probably meant to sell at a low off-contract price.

"Dock Your Smartphone Into Your Car Display With Mhl Wiring

 Above: Judy Chen showed how your phone can be wired into your car display, which can mirror the image on the phone. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi/VentureBeat   A lot of mobile apps could be useful in your car, but most vehicles don’t have the equipment to deliver them to you safely and easily. But the MHL consortium has begun a push to embed the proper wiring in cars so you can connect your Android smartphone or tablet to the display in your car.  The new adapters in cars are part of a trend to make your vehicle into an electronic haven .  Hyundai, JVC-Kenwood, and Pioneer showed off working versions of the connectors at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Hyundai showed how an Android smartphone could connect via a micro-USB connector on a phone to a HDMI port in a new Hyundai automobile (pictured right). That enabled a driver to access mobile apps on the touchscreen display in the car.  With a larger display, it becomes a lot easier to control an app, such as a navigation program. You can also operate the app at high speed and with outstanding visual quality, as MHL supports 1080p video transfer and eight channels of digital audio. You can also charge your phone through the connector. The car display functions as a second screen for the mobile device. What is cool is that you can control the smart device by touching the car display, which sends commands back to the smart device instantaneously.  The MHL technology fit right in with the 2014 model of the Hyundai Genesis sedan, which has a fancy car infotainment system with Bluetooth 3.0, a full set of digital audio services (Gracenote, Pandora, Sirius XM radio, and HD radio). It has a 9.2-inch screen and uses face-recognition technology to identify you when you get into the driver’s seat. It has a BlueLink system that allows you to hook the MHL-enabled device into the car’s display.  “We have a lot of momentum in the automotive market,” said Judy Chen (pictured), the president of the MHL consortium, as we walked around the automotive section of the CES show floor. “It makes sense because your smartphone will have a lot more computing power than the computer in the car, which you won’t be replacing every year.”  The car maker filters programs through Hyundai’s certified app, which uses “driver assist” technology. That means it will not allow you to view certain kinds of apps, like movies or games, while the car is driving. You can, however, access those apps while the car transmission is in park. This adapter technology will allow you to use many more apps than simply the ones that a car maker might build into a navigation unit.  “You can’t just run any app because of safety issues,” Chen said. “And you can’t have any lag. If you are driving a car and you’re having trouble reading your screen or touching your screen, then you have a real safety problem. This is nice because it is instantaneous. You can use voice commands as well.”  Silicon Image created the original cable, which has now been broadly adopted. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based MHL was founded in 2010 by Nokia, Samsung, Silicon Image, Sony, and Toshiba. Their aim was to create a standard for audio and video connectivity for mobile devices. You can use MHL to plug your smartphone into a big-screen TV so you can watch your mobile content on a big display and charge your phone at the same time. The MHL connector has five pins, with five separate wires, that allow it to deliver data without delays. It can provide 900 milliamps of power back to the mobile device.  Hyundai plans to introduce the MHL (which stands for Mobile High-Definition Link) capability in upcoming models of cars. JVC-Kenwood and Pioneer showed MHL working with aftermarket stereo equipment at CES. BMW has also adopted MHL, but it hasn’t described what it will do with it yet.  MHL is gathering momentum, Chen said. The installed base to date is more than 220 million products and 180 participating companies. In the past year, the industry released the first MHL-enabled digital video recorders, Blu-ray players, laptop docks, PC monitors and projectors.  “Next-generation infotainment is extremely important to Hyundai, and MHL technology’s high-performance solution paves the road to integrate tomorrow’s mobile technologies into today’s cars,” said Michael O’Brien, vice president of product and corporate planning at Hyundai Motor America.  Some of the high-profile MHL-enabled products include the Samsung Galaxy S3, The Samsung Galaxy Note, HTC One X, Sony Xperia T, Pioneer AppRadio 2, Roku media streaming stick, and the ClamBook.  For now, those devices will simply mirror their screens on the car screen. But over time, MHL will like head in the direction of enabling other applications, such as embedding a mobile screen within a sector of the larger screen.

"Amazon Pokes Fun At Apple, Jony Ive And The Ipad Air In Latest Kindle Advert

Oh, Amazon. You’re silly. But also very right. In Amazon’s latest assault on the gadget establishment, the Kindle HDK 8.9 takes on the iPad Air, correctly pointing out that Amazon’s offering has a better screen and is lighter than its Apple counterpart. Plus, the Kindle HDX 8.9 is cheaper. With this advert, Amazon joins Microsoft in selling their wares directly against Apple’s. This commercial, like some of the Windows tablet tv spots, is rather blunt, right down to a mocking tone of the voice-over narrator. But, arguably, unlike the Microsoft attacks, Amazon’s selling points are valid and worth considering for some buyers. The Kindle HDX 8.9 is a worthy competitor against the iPad. The screen is more dense and generally higher quality. The HDX is lighter and cheaper. For a good chunk of buyers, as in, those looking to watch YouTube videos, play some older games, and shop Amazon, the HDX is a great option. The only thing the HDX lacks is access to Apple’s iCloud ecosystem that brilliantly syncs commonly used communication and productivity tools across Apple computers and mobile devices. Amazon has steadily grown into a legitimate consumer electronic company. From humble starts with the original Kindle, the retail giant knows how to start small and scale into a major player. Is the Kindle HDX better than the iPad? Not really, but the gap is quickly closing. Plus, drones .

"Megite'S Alternative Way To Rank Popular Videos

Megite , a blog aggregation news service ( see here for a comparison of Megite to its competitors) has launched a videos vertical that tracks popular videos in an interesting way. Unlike the Digg video channel , which ranks videos based solely on user voting, Megite’s ranking is based on what vidoes blogs are linking to or embedding into their sites (the same way Megite tracks other news). An authoritative blog linking to a video can drive it up in the rankings, as will a large number of less authoritative blogs. The “freshness” of the video is also important (meaning Megite is tracking newly uploaded videos). Megite is tracking 20 video sites, although understandably YouTube is currently dominating the results. This is a good way to rank videos because it suffers from less potential voting fraud than, say, Digg. If an established blog links to a video there’s a very good chance it is a real vote for that video. Taking aggregate statistics from tens of thousands of blogs will tend to yield very good results. More from Rex Dixon , who also links to an interview he recently conducted with Megite founder Matthew Chen.

"Report: Zynga To Hire Microsoft’S Game Chief Don Mattrick As Ceo

 [ Update : Zynga confirmed the story.]  Don Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s game business, is expected to leave the company and become the CEO of social gaming giant Zynga, according to a report in the  AllThingsD .  If that happens, it would be a major change for the game industry, as Mattrick is widely considered to be one of the most experienced and best executives in the video game business.  Mattrick’s expected departure might also set back Microsoft’s plans to launch its Xbox One game console and possibly frustrate Electronic Arts’ search for a new chief executive. Microsoft and Zynga declined to comment to the AllThingsD , and we’ve asked both for a comment. The report cited multiple anonymous sources that the announcement could be made as early as today, after the markets close. Zynga’s stock price is up 9.5 percent to $3.05 a share, which is good for recent trading but is far below the $10 a share initial public offering price. Microsoft’s stock dipped slightly, down 0.2 percent.  Mattrick would likely be one of the only industry executives with enough credibility to convince Pincus to give up the reins at Zynga, the social game company that he founded in 2007. Zynga saw a meteoric rise as gaming took off on Facebook, and it went public in 2011. But as the company grew to more than 3,000 people, it lost its mojo. Competition on Facebook rose, and Zynga failed to execute on the transition to mobile games, where other companies such as King and Supercell have the advantage. The stock has been under pressure for more than a year, particularly since John Schappert, the No. 2 executive at Zynga and a former Electronic Arts veteran, resigned from the company .  Mattrick spent many years as a top executive at EA and ran its worldwide game studios until he made the jump to Microsoft in 2007. There, he helped spearhead the launch of the Kinect motion-sensing system and helped turn around Microsoft’s business in gaming, making it consistently profitable. For the past couple of years, Microsoft has had the most momentum in the console game business and it recently announced the details on the Xbox One, a next-generation game console that will launch in November. In that respect, the timing of the announcement will be tough for Microsoft, if it is correct.  Mattrick had been considered a frontrunner to be the next CEO of EA, whose previous boss, John Riccitiello, resigned earlier this year. Both EA and Zynga are in need of a seasoned hand as the gaming markets evolve and competitive landscape changes. Zynga recently shut down a bunch of games and laid off more than 500 employees. EA is trying to hold costs down, even as it staffs up for next-generation games on the new consoles.  Zynga’s board could hire Mattrick only with the consent of Pincus, who still controls more than half of the company’s voting stock. We’ve heard that Mattrick, a Canadian native, has a new home in the Bay Area and that he has long wanted to return  to the region.  Mattrick’s most recent strategy, as revealed in the unveiling of the Xbox One, got mixed reviews. Gamers reacted negatively to policies relating to consumer rights. Specifically, they hated that Microsoft planned to curtail the sale and use of used games, didn’t have a clear position on privacy related to the new Kinect camera in the system, and would require an online check-in for the box every 24 hours. Sony also undercut Microsoft by pricing the rival PlayStation 4 (also coming this fall) at $399, while Microsoft pegged its initial price at $499.  Microsoft had to backpedal on the consumer rights policies, but it hasn’t changed its price yet. While those foibles were widely criticized, it’s not likely that those matters alone would cause Mattrick to seek a new job, at least in my opinion.

"‘Going Out App’ Yplan Raises $12M As It Preps A New York Expansion

  YPlan wants to make sure you always know what you’re doing tonight.  The curated events list app is raising $12 million in round of funding led by General Catalyst Partners. The company says it plans to use this funding to expand its footprint beyond London to new cities, including New York, where it’s set to land later this year. (In addition to the latest funding, the company also raised $1.7 million last July.)  Launched last November, YPlan offers a daily curated shortlist of a city’s most notable events. It’s catching on, too: Months after its launch, YPlan has already been downloaded 200,000 times, and according to YPlan, it has already hit 10 percent of London phones.  Of course it’s too early to say whether YPlan will reach that level of success when it launches in New York, but we’ll know for sure in the second half of this year. (If you want to help YPlan along, the company is already looking for developers for its New York expansion .)

"Spain'S Ticketbis Raises $6.6 Million To Continue Global Expansion

 Ticketbis.net , the Madrid-based online ticket service, announced Wednesday that it has closed another round of funding, worth $6.6 million.  That makes a total of $12.7 million over the past four years.  While Ticketbis started in Spain, and expanded to the U.S. this year, it primarily focuses on Latin America, Asia, and Europe, where the market is still new for letting individuals buy and sell tickets to events online.  The company’s service is now available in 31 countries and has 300 employees in 14 offices around the globe.  The latest round was led by Active Venture Partners , which focuses on investments in Spain, Germany, and Scandinavia.  “Ticketbis continues to generate impressive results that demonstrate the team’s great ability to execute its plans and achieve its goals,” said Blair MacLaren, a partner at Active, in a press release.

"Revel Goes Big With Full Stadium Deployment Of Ipad Point-Of-Sale System At Asu

iPad-based point-of-sale market leader Revel has just completed its biggest single deployment to date, outfitting the entire Alabama State University stadium with Revel POS equipment. The brand new stadium for the ASU Hornets now has Revel-powered iPads at all 30 concession stands throughout the facility, and progress and sales at each can be monitored in real-time by facility managers. The stadium-specific retail installation has some neat tricks over other vendor offerings and traditional POS, because it doesn’t require Internet connectivity to function. Revel says this has already proven its worth at the ASU facility, since during a power outage at a recent game the Revel-powered systems continued to operate so concessions could continue to make sales. Also, the San Francisco-based company says its POS software is about 14 percent faster per transaction than a traditional POS, which means it can process a higher volume of customers more quickly. Since its founding in 2010, Revel has been steadily expanding its focus. The company initially started out serving the restaurant and fast food industry, and then later moved into retail businesses . Back in June, it raised $10M to help its business grow in markets beyond the U.S. , but this latest development shows it’s still concerned with expanding its client base at home, too. The arena food and goods market is one that resembles Revel’s existing clients, but with the twist of scale. Concessions can serve thousands of customers per hour, and often see extremely high-volume busy periods at key lull points in the game. Revel says it has designed its system to be ideally suited to these kinds of hurry-up periods, increasing the rate of customers served and therefore increasing customer satisfaction and overall sales. Revel is clearly angling for more sales in this arena (oh yeah, I went there). which could prove a lucrative opportunity not only among U.S. colleges and professional sports teams, but abroad as well. The biggest challenge in this market is that these organizations don’t do mass retrofits all that often, but Revel has ease of onboarding as well as fairly cheap installation going for it to help overcome that perceived barrier.

"Star Wars Galaxies Players Start Petition To Make Game Free-To-Play

 [Update: The petition has now gathered more than 2,100 signatures]  Enraged and frustrated players of Sony’s online Star Wars role-playing game, Star Wars Galaxies, have launched a petition to try to save the game from being shut down on December 15.  The petition has gathered more than 2,100 signatures in three days. It asks Sony to convert the game to a free-to-play game that is maintained through the sale of virtual goods. The petition also asks Sony to consolidate players onto a smaller number of servers and facilitate character transfer to reduce operational costs in order to keep the game running.  Other online games have had a lot of success converting from a subscription-based model to a free-to-play model. Revenue from Turbine’s Lord of the Rings Online doubled and its player base increased by 400 percent when the game went free to play in October. Revenue for the company’s first experiment in going free-to-play, Dungeons and Dragons Online, jumped by about 500 percent after the shift.  Here’s how the free-to-play, or “freemium”, model works: players are able to play online games with persistent worlds like Lord of the Rings Online for free, but must pay for additional perks like armor or becoming more powerful at a quicker pace. The freemium model isn’t necessarily new. Many successful smaller online games — like Maple Story — that have a smaller player base and might not be viable with a subscription model have used the freemium model.  I argued that the death of Star Wars Galaxies was basically a tragedy because it came at the hands of the game’s own publisher rather than the popularity of another game . World of Warcraft, currently the top online role-playing game, played a role in reducing the game’s total subscribers. But Sony’s updates were what inevitably killed it and drove away players. Star Wars Galaxies, which once boasted a unique progression system, trading and crafting features, was basically converted to a watered down version of World of Warcraft through a number of updates.  Here’s one post from a Star Wars Galaxies fan who is trying to promote the petition. It’s just one example of the ridiculously devoted community the game has constructed during its eight-year run.  We are not your typical gamers.  We are not a commodity.  But if you look at the recent decision by Lucasarts to shut down Star Wars Galaxies, you might be inclined to think we are both of those things. Lucasarts thinks that we are a non-perishable commodity that can be shoved into a shipping crate and moved down the road to their next project. That is not the case. Not even close.  We are a vibrant community. We have seen our ups and downs, but we are only stronger because of it. We have endured all manner of broken promises and misleading “improvements” to this game, and throughout all of it, we have continued to build our community, and show support and loyalty to this great game. But we didn’t do it because of a game. We did it because of our community here.  No matter how hard you try, you can never apply any sort of label or definition to the players of Star Wars Galaxies. Unfortunately, it seems like Lucasarts is doing just that by assuming we will simply shuffle over to their next product simply because it contains the words “Star Wars” in the title. But oh, that is so far from the truth. We are not your typical gamers, and we are not your typical Star Wars fans. In fact, both of those truths are the very things that make our community so strong.  The world is obsessed with trying to apply labels to groups of people, and will often do so on the basis of pure assumptions and hearsay. You can’t do that with Star Wars Galaxies players. We are not some geeky group of people who simply want to log into a video game and shoot battle droids and fly spaceships with laser guns.  Many of us are highly educated. Many of us have children and families. Many of us have great careers.  Just the other day I learned that a great player on my server of Starsider was once the mayor-elect of his city in Canada. And what’s more, he was 18 years old. I have known a concert violinist, a fireman, a surgeon, a newspaper editor, an EMT, a helicopter pilot, and on and on and on. And all of these people I met through Star Wars Galaxies.  On top of all that, many Star Wars Galaxies players are active service military personnel. I remember once talking to a member of my guild and having him tell me he was logged into Star Wars Galaxies from his base in Iraq. Without a moment’s hesitation, I got his unit’s mailing address and sent him and his comrades a care package. Star Wars Galaxies made that connection possible.  So much happens because of Star Wars Galaxies that goes unnoticed. This is much more than a game to the people who play it. It’s our community. And a community is not a commodity, so don’t be surprised when we want nothing to do with the people who are trying to force us to give up our community just so they can make a few extra bucks.

"Nutonomy Raises $16M To Make Self-Driving Taxis A Reality By 2018

Another week, another story about a promising independent self-driving vehicle company. Last week, Otto came out of stealth to offer autonomous technology for trucks , and today MIT spinoff NuTonomy announced $16 million in funding to go after its ambitious goal of offering self-driving taxis within two years. Cambridge, MA-based NuTonomy was founded by MIT PhDs graduates Karl Iagnemma (CEO) and Emilio Frazzoli (CTO) in 2013 and it is pioneering self-driving technology for cars — yes, the very kind of vehicle that Uber , Google , BMW , GM/Lyft , China’s Baidu and others are currently developing. Like Otto but unlike the aforementioned big names, NuTonomy retrofits existing cars with the technology to make them driverless. The company announced a $3.6 million seed round in January, which included input from Ford chairman Bill Ford’s Fontinalis Partners fund, and today it revealed its $16 million Series A round. The new investment is led by Highland Capital Partners, with participation from the Singapore Economic Development Board (via its EDBI investment arm), Ford’s fund and other existing backers including Signal Ventures and Samsung Ventures. NuTonomy maintains strong links with Singapore. The investment aside, it has an office in the city-state and it has trialled self-driving vehicles there. Initially it began in 2014 with autonomous golf cart-style buggies summoned by a smartphone app, but now it is testing a fleet of self-driving taxis which it believes could be deployed commercially in Singapore by 2018. The startup is working closely with SMART (Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology) as part of the organization’s broad mandate to improve Singapore and its residents’ lifestyles through technology. Singapore’s smart city initiative covers topics as diverse as cashless wallets, open government APIs, a push to promote entrepreneurialism, and increased security surveillance, but self-driving car tech is also on the agenda. NuTonomy is making inroads in Singapore — and winning the backing of the country’s tech sector — at an interesting time. The country only introduced the first steps to manage on-demand taxi services in April, and yet already the very self-driving concepts they are in the first stages of testing in the U.S. are edging close to hitting the roads in Singapore, which are being designed and architected specifically to support driverless vehicles. Self-driving NuTonomy cars are also being tested in Michigan and the UK, where Jaguar Land Rover is among the partners.

"Mage Gaming: Bringing Theory And Criticism To Gaming!

   So, myself and a group of people I know from around the university were thinking about making a gaming channel on YouTube but that spark died out fast when we stopped to consider just how many mediocre, mindless, meandering channels there already were. What in the world would we bring to the table?  So that died out, everyone forgot about it, well, most of them didn't even pick it up in the first place. It was originally my idea so it makes sense that I had the hardest time putting it back down. It was one day debating, as per the norm, the various intricacies of one game or the other and it's overall theme that I realized we already were doing something that wasn't so whored out by the vast quantity of 12 year old fanboys on teh interwebz0rz. I know, hax, right? This was when the idea to bring the world of Academia to gaming sprung up. The others were skeptical at first, they weren't entirely sure they could bring themselves to share supposedly intellectual thought with the world and risk looking like total idiots.  Well, after assuring them that that was the best part and that I'd take a stab at it first to show them what it was like the channel came into existence. What I've proposed is to bring the intellectual world to gaming. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say this hasn't been done or that it's entirely original. I'm not that much of an idiot. But either way, I'm an English major and a writer to boot so when I can't see a reason why almost everything that I do in my coursework with novels can't translate into gaming, well, that just goes to show there's a whole world there.  Anyways, that brings me here, to Bitmob for the usual critiquing from the mass public of peers. I'm ambitious enough to start this and devote a lot of time into it but I'm not stupid enough to think it's going to be 1337 HaXz0rZ. Even if the concept were gold (not going to comment one way or the other) I still need to hear from you, yes, you, right there, reading this right now, and hear your opinions on what I've got to say. It should never be a narrative, but the basis for a discussion.  So, Bitmob and all you Mobs of intelligent people, what do you think?  My first video is on the role of Shiro Tagachi, the antagonist of Guild Wars Fucktions. I debate whether or not he's a real antagonist, though, I must admit there was just not enough time to talk about every aspect. The other Envoys, for example. Never once mentioned them when they themselves could easily be viewed as the antagonists.  Either way, please take a look and lemme know what you think!     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXXNY-R93Zk  [embed:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXXNY-R93Zk ]

"Microsoft Says ‘Hardcore Gamers’ Will Be The First To Buy Kinect. Um…

Whatever you say, Microsoft . The House that Gates built believes that “hardcore gamers” will be the first to buy the Kinect , which comes out in November. Or, in the exact words of one of their marketing managers: “I think we know that hardcore gamers will be the first to go out and buy it, as they are with any product.” That’s interesting, seeing as though a recent survey suggests that only 8 percent of 360 owners intended to buy Kinect (or Natal, as it was known at the time). Look, I played Kinect at E3 , and I’m sure that some people will get a kick out of it, but I’m not one of those people. It’s not that I think it’s “dumb” or anything like that, but that it simply does not interest me. There’s a reason I’ve played Wii for all of 10 minutes in my life: it’ not my thing. Now, maybe it’s your thing. Maybe you’re all about the Wii, the Kinect, the PlayStation Move. In which case maybe you’ll be one of the first people in your area code to plop down for the Kinect. But as a “hardcore gamer,” which has to be the stupidest label in the history of stupid labels, I can honestly say I have zero interest in the Kinect and its ilk. Good luck to everyone involved, of course, but I’m going to comfortably sit out this phase of gaming. If you need me, I’ll be over there, with the mouse and keyboard (or, sometimes, with the controller.)

"Vurve Destealthing: Advertising On Autopilot For Small Businesses

If you’re a big company and you need a little software help managing online advertising campaigns, you go to Omniture or a competitor. But if you’re running a small store and are only spending a few hundred or a few thousand dollars a month across Google, Facebook and other self serve platforms, there are far fewer options available to you. That’s where Vurve comes in, and they are coming out of a small private beta period today. The company, which raised a $1.2 million venture round last year, is run by Amit Kumar . Kumar was previously Director of Product at Yahoo, and VP Product at ad startup Dapper prior to being acquired by Yahoo. He knows advertising. The company addresses the complications of online marketing – 75% of small businesses would rather do taxes than deal with online advertising, says Microsoft. Vurve makes it much simpler. There are easy to use tools and analytics to auto-create and place ads, and then make changes based on what works. Vurve isn’t for everyone – you must spend a minimum of $200/month to use the service. And there’s also a maximum spend of $10,000 per month. Above that, you’re too big for them and they want to stay focused on the small guys. Still, it’s a $7 billion market, says the company. For now they’re only working with shops using the Shopify or Yahoo Shopping platforms, Over time they’ll expand to other platforms, and possibly allow a direct connection for non-platform shops as well. On the advertising side, Vurve has preferred API access with Google and Facebook.

"Ios 5 Update: Dictation Feature Found In Latest Beta Release

 No Sunday slumber for developers: Apple released its fifth beta (pre-release) version of iOS 5 today. The update , which is only available to developers, can be downloaded wirelessly to iOS devices.  Above: Image courtesy of 9to5Mac  There are still bugs in the beta, such as volume sliders not updating when volume buttons are activated. But the update provides hints of some big new features.  9to5Mac reports that speech to text capabilities are built into the iOS 5 keyboard in this release. This indicates Apple may actually be using technology from Nuance , a voice recognition software company, as earlier rumors suggested. In June, Macstories reported an internal iOS 5 screenshots leak showing “Nuance Diction” controls.  In the current update, the feature appears as a microphone icon nestled next to the keyboard space bar. When clicked, a page showing the icon appears. The page stays up for as long as you are talking. When talking ceases, the screen reverts to the keyboard page, with your spoken words appearing in the text box.  Nuance recently purchased iPad notetaking app Noterize , leading to hopes for a built-in speech to text note taking option.  However, the capabilities will only be available on Apple’s “smaller products,” the iPhone and iPod touch, according to an unnamed source in the 9to5Mac story. This is surprising given the ri se of iPad usage for education innovation, with companies like Kno and Inkling creating whole textbooks on the device. iOS 5 is still in beta, however, nothing is set in stone.  A hearing aid functionality was also discovered by YouTuber NatesTechUpdate (video below), which can be toggled on or off from the accessibility page, found in settings. The feature will improve use with hearing aids, but may reduce 2G cellular coverage, according to the feature description.  Apple first announced iOS 5 at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June. Features announced at that time included iMessage, a very similar product to RIM’s Blackberry Messenger Service, Twitter integration, a new look for push notifications and more.  Apple encourages developers to back up their content before installing the iOS 5 beta 5 to avoid bugs such as loss of photos after iTunes backup restoration. See the full change log on BGR .

Microsoft announced today that a Windows update coming on Oct. 20 will allow Windows users to align their PCs with the recently announced North Korea time zone.  “Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has implemented its own time zone with UTC +8:30,” Microsoft wrote today in a short post on its Daylight Saving Time & Time Zone Blog. “… Microsoft is planning to release this update on Hotfix server on October 20, 2015.”  Microsoft said a couple of months ago that it was “investigating creating a new time zone” to accommodate the North Koreans’ move to reestablish the time zone they had before Japanese colonial rule began in the early 1900s.  The Windows update will also end Turkey’s daylight savings time earlier than usual and will introduce an 11-week daylight savings time for Fiji, Microsoft said.  Google and Apple have not, as of yet, committed to supporting North Korea’s time change.

"Hands On With Epson’S New Runsense Smartwatch

 LAS VEGAS — Epson is one of a number of big brands we saw at CES looking to get in on the wearable craze, announcing a new fitness watch last week.  It’s actually a line of three slightly different running watches, collectively called Runsense . The Runsense SF-810 — the one Epson was showing at CES — acts a lot like a stopwatch on the wrist, with an accelerometer and heartbeat monitor added in.  The visible-light heartbeat sensor is located on the back of the watch and monitors heart rate continuously. There’s also an accelerometer inside, a GPS radio, and algorithms to give runners a constant look at performance levels during workouts. The watch is supposed to be able to calculate the length of the runner’s stride, too, and factor that into its calculations.  The watch looks like it would be heavy and unwieldy, but it actually felt light and manageable on my wrist.  Tthe Runsense watches get into some very detailed metrics for serious runners. In all, the watch tracks 35 measurements, including time elapsed, distance, pace, laps, intervals, speed, and calories burned.   My only real problem with the Runsense watch was the read it took of my heart rate. I was in a reasonably relaxed state, yet the watch measured a BPM of 90, well over the 65 or so BPM I usually log.   Many runners’ watches rely on a chest strap to get an accurate heart rate reading, and some people I’ve talked to in the health industry say they are skeptical of the accuracy of wrist-based sensing.   Two of the buttons on the watch — the Start/Stop and Lap buttons — are dedicated to stopwatch functions, while the Display/Hour button toggles the data on the screen and the Light button turns on the backlighting so that the watch face can be seen at night.   Here’s the Runsense watch with the backlight turned on.   While I didn’t have time to jog around the convention center testing all the timing features, I have no doubt they work fine. One thing I liked about the watch was the sheer number of data points that you can see by looking down quickly at its face.  I’m not a serious runner, but for those who train by running laps and timing them, the watch is a nice tool. A capacitor inside the watch gives the runner’s wrist a little buzz when his normal lap time has expired. The watch can also be set to vibrate when the wearer is getting close to a workout goal (number of laps) he’s set in advance.  The Runsense watches can sync with an app running on smartphones, tablets, or computers using Bluetooth.  An Epson rep told me that the SF-810 will become available in the first half of this year for $350, with the SF-510 ($250) and the SF-710 ($280) coming later.

"Alexia’S Headphones: How We Used Crowdtilt’S Group-Funding Platform To Replace Stolen Property

On the 25th of June, our dearest Alexia Tsotsis had an incredibly rough day . First, her car was looted by very bad people in San Francisco, who stole her laptop and a pair of excellent Bose headphones that were near and dear to her heart. And as if that wasn’t enough, her car then got smashed by someone running a red light, totaling her vehicle and leaving her in quite a bit of pain. When fellow TechCrunch sharks heard the news, we knew we had to do something to help out one of our fearless leaders, and so our very own Ryan Lawler stepped up to the plate with a suggestion to buy some new headphones for Alexia. “Knowing that we can’t replace the sentimental value, I was thinking we could maybe (at least) help replace the item that was taken.” After a little back and forth, the team settled on an app to help us accomplish the task at hand (we at TC need an app for everything), and that’s where CrowdTilt enters the mix. CrowdTilt is an online platform that allows anyone to start a group-funding campaign, which is different from crowd-funding. ( Rip covered their launch in February .) According to CrowdTilt, group-funding is where a group of people give money to fund an objective where the entire group benefits, whereas crowd-funding lets the general public fund an individual’s goal or objective. There are a few small caveats to the service, including a required Facebook login for campaign starters and U.S.-only availability at the moment. For Ryan, our own campaign starter, signing up with Facebook is no big deal. We’re hyper-connected. But for someone who doesn’t want to access third-party apps through Facebook (and there are quite a few people like this in the world), this may be a road block. CrowdTilt explains on its FAQ that the Facebook log-in for campaign starters is meant to make other contributors aware of who they’re giving money to, which is noble for sure, but not always convenient for the campaign starter. Another issue we had was the lack of international availability. Sure, every startup needs time to scale, but our poor Ingrid Lunden and Mike Butcher had to contribute via PayPal, as their UK billing addresses weren’t accepted. If your eye can spy in the image below, founder James Beshara joined us to make his own contribution to the campaign. He was also nice enough to manually close the campaign for us when Facebook Connect was acting up on Wednesday. So Alexia, when you sit down to write everyone a thank you card (likely with another app), make sure to include James. This slideshow requires JavaScript.

"Yahoo Adds Lyrics Shortcut To Search

Yahoo began publishing the music lyrics on Yahoo Music last week – the first time they appear legally on the Internet. Today they announced a Yahoo search shortcut to find song lyrics very quickly. Just type an artist name or song name and “+ lyrics” to see lyric results for the artist or song above other search results. See, for example, lyrics for the Beatles , U2 and the Smiths . Yahoo Lyrics are not perfect – copyright restrictions force them to show lyrics as an image instead of free text, to avoid scraping. This prevents search engine indexing as well, though.

"Mozilla Firefox Will Drop Support For Npapi Plugins By The End Of 2016, But Will Keep Flash Around

 Mozilla today announced its intention to remove Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI) plugin support from Firefox “by the end of 2016.” The company has been working, along with other web proponents, to implement functionality like streaming video, advanced graphics, and gaming features that used to be available only via NPAPI plugins.  NPAPI plugins are seen as a problem because of their negative impact on a browser’s security, speed, and stability, not to mention the complexity of the code base. As Mozilla noted, other browser makers have also ditched NPAPI plugins. Google dropped support in April with the release of Chrome 42 , and Microsoft killed them with the launch of Edge in July .  For years now, Firefox has allowed for manual plugin activation, letting users activate plugins only when they became necessary. Furthermore, new Firefox platforms do not have to support an existing ecosystem of users and plugins, so platforms such as 64-bit Firefox for Windows will launch without plugin support.  Mozilla recommends that websites and publishers that currently use plugins such as Silverlight or Java should “accelerate their transition to Web technologies.” You have until the end of next year to ditch your reliance on plugins. (If you use Java applets, for example, Oracle recommends switching to plugin-free solutions such as Java Web Start.)  Just like Google and Microsoft, Mozilla is making an exception for Flash:  Because Adobe Flash is still a common part of the Web experience for most users, we will continue to support Flash within Firefox as an exception to the general plugin policy. Mozilla and Adobe will continue to collaborate to bring improvements to the Flash experience on Firefox, including on stability and performance, features and security architecture.  Mozilla is also working with Unity to enable Unity-based content directly in the browser without plugins. If you’re an interested developer, Unity has shared an updated roadmap for its Web Player technology.  Last but not least, keep in mind that Mozilla is making major changes to Firefox add-on development , also with more focus on Web technologies.

"Video Stays Hot — Motorola To Buy Broadbus?

          Motorola is close to acquiring East Coast company that sells servers and other products for television-on-demand offerings, Broadbus Inc , for approximately $186 million in cash, PE Week reports .  It has raised $57 million since 1999 at varying valuations from investors like Battery Ventures, Charles River Ventures, Comcast Interactive, Star Ventures and Wolf Ventures — so we’re not certain if there was a payoff or not. But could it stoke the frenzy among Silicon Valley investors to invest in these sorts of video delivery infrastructure companies, or push big companies to more aggressively snap them up? PE Week says Cisco has targeted Arroyo Video Solutions, of Pleasanton, as an alternative. We haven’t confirmed any of this. A Motorola spokesman declined to confirm or deny the deal.  Broadbus has sold to major cable providers, like Adelphia, Charter Communications, Comcast, Rogers Cable and Time Warner Cable.

"Box Goes International, Partners With Podio In Europe For Cloud Storage

On the heels of Box’s strong growth in 2011 — now at 8 million users and 100,000 businesses — and plans to offer the service to the Feds , comes another sign of the enterprise-cloud storage startup’s fast growth: it is moving into Europe. Today the company is announcing a deal with Podio , a social business collaboration platform, to offer storage services to Podio customers. Those customers today officially number at 40,000 but unofficially are “quite a lot higher” says a spokesperson. The company expanded to the U.S. last year and plans to give an update on growth in March. Box has been around since 2005 but it is only more recently that the company’s business has really taken off — and so it makes sense for the company to put deeper roots into partnerships with international companies that can help the business grow more there. Podio tells me that it is the first European partner for Box. Although technically Box already integrates with some 150 platform partners including those with international reach like Salesforce.com, Google, Jive and Yammer, this one more specifically will mean another social networking platform that Box can offer to its 8 million users. Podio has been ramping up its partnerships at a faster rate of late: the Google partnership — to integrate the Podio platform with Google Docs — in fact was only announced a couple of weeks ago. For Podio, a social network for businesses that lets those who use it create apps to enhance the functionality of the service (or a “ Yammer with apps ,” as we once called it) the deal gives its users another feature — cloud storage from a well-known brand — to add to the list already offered by other partners. Those partners include Google Apps, Campaign Monitor, Evernote, FreshBooks, Instapaper and Zendesk.

"Moolah Media Launches Real-Time Bidding Platform For Mobile Ads, Says It’S Seeing $1M+ In Monthly Revenue

Performance-based mobile ad startup Moolah Media is announcing that it’s taking its real-time bidding platform out of beta. It’s also sharing its revenue numbers today. The company had already talked up its RTB platform (namely, its technology allowing the advertisers to manage the bidding on multiple ad networks and exchanges) as a big selling point behind the display advertising network that it launched in March, highlighting the fact that advertisers can determine the specific sites where their ads can and can’t be shown. Now, however, Moolah is officially taking the RTB feature out of beta. When I discussed the technology with CEO Shawn Scheuer last week, he emphasized its speed. The company has placed its ad serving hubs geographically close to its publishing partners, leading to response times of less than 30 milliseconds. That’s crucial, he said, because when publishers are trying to fill an ad, they’re often need to check with multiple networks in less than a second. Although Moolah’s big selling point has been its performance-based pricing model, the RTB platform supports pricing based on impressions (CPM), actions (CPA), and clicks (CPC). It’s built using the RTB 2.0 Standard. The company is also announcing that it’s now bringing in $1 million a month in revenue. That’s about double what Moolah was making a year ago, Scheuer said, and he expects to double revenue again next year. Not that the growth has been entirely smooth — he said it usually works more like a “step function”, with revenue staying fairly steady, and then making a big leap as new employees join and get up-to-speed. Moolah would have grown more quickly, Scheuer said, if it had raised outside funding — he pitched VCs early on, but they were skeptical the company could actually make the performance model work on mobile. So by necessity, the company has had to focus on profitability. “I think we’ll prove that you can build a mobile advertising company that’s profitable, that it can be done at our scale, without any external investment,” he said.

"Some Android Apps Stink At Securing User Data, Say Researchers

  While the bulk of mobile security research is focused on intentionally malicious apps, it’s the benign ones that you should really be afraid of.  That’s the latest conclusion made by Android security researchers , who found that dozens of Android apps had lax security that exposed user data to theft, Ars Technica reports .  At the core of the researchers’ exploits are so-called “man-in-the-middle” attacks, which steal data by piggybacking on compromised WiFi networks. Once users connect to them, hackers can strike, intercepting poorly encrypted data such as banking information, log-in credentials, emails, and instant message transcripts.  These 40 or so apps, researchers say, are used by as many as 185 million people, few of whom are aware of the issues. Fortunately for app makers, the researchers were kind enough not to share the names of these insecure apps, which isn’t exactly helpful to those Android users who might have them installed.  Much of the problem, the researchers say, lies in poor implementation of encryption protocols by app developers, who they say aren’t as focused on data security as they should be. The solution? Google has to do a better job of enforcing more stringent security measures, the researchers say.  But what about iOS? While the researchers focus on Android, it’s possible that iOS apps are also exposed to these same security holes. That’s because the issue is larger than the operating system: Any app using poor encryption is vulnerable to the same problems, regardless of the platform it’s on. That’s why the app approval process is so important.

"  Audi Leads $28M Investment In Rental Startup Silvercar

Silvercar, a startup rethinking the auto rental experience in airports, already seems pretty tied to Audi — after all, every vehicle that Silvercar rents out is a silver Audi. Now the companies are deepening that relationship with a $28 million Series C investment. Audi led the round, with the company’s North American president Scott Keogh joining Silvercar’s board of directors. Silvercar and Audi are also looking beyond airports with a new initiative called the Audi Shared Fleet, where businesses will be able to offer cars to employees on their corporate campuses. “Silvercar represents not just the future of the car rental industry, but a vision for the future of mobility,” Keogh said in the funding release “We want to utilize the company’s strengths in technology and innovation to merge connectivity and mobility for today’s consumer.” Silvercar has raised a total of $60 million in funding. Previous investors Austin Ventures and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin also participated in the new round. Writer Ryan Lawler (now sadly departed from TechCrunch) tried the service out three years ago in Dallas-Fort Worth, Silvercar’s very first airport. He came away impressed with “the ease of getting in and out of the airport rental dock,” and he suggested that business travelers, in particular, might be willing to pay a premium to get a better experience. (The exact pricing varies from market to market.) The company says its business tripled in 2015, and it’s now launching in its twelfth market, Las Vegas, just in time for this week’s Consumer Electronics Show.

"Fda Clears New Uses For Aragon Surgical’S Laparascopic Device

 Aragon Surgical, a Palo Alto, Calif., medical-devices maker, said the FDA cleared its LapCap product for use in general surgery. Aragon, which doesn’t seem to have a Web site, gained ownership of the LapCap when it acquired VeriSure, another device maker, in March .  The LapCap is designed to ease the initial steps of minimally invasive, or laparoscopic, surgery , in which surgeons must pass a needle into the abdomen in order to blow in gas that will expand the abdominal cavity. The LapCap guides this needle into the proper location, helping to avoid inadvertent needle-related injuries. The device was previously only cleared for use in gynecologic laparoscopies.  Aragon is backed by Delphi Ventures and Onset Ventures .

"500 Ios Games Per Day: Flooded Mobile Market Is Tricky For Indie Devs

 Click here for all of GameBeat’s 2015 Game Developers Conference coverage.  SAN FRANCISCO — If you’re working on a mobile game right now, you might want to look away.  Hundreds of new games come out every day on the Apple App Store and Google Play. In 2014, about 500 new iOS games and 250 Android games appeared in their respective stores every 24 hours. The staggering numbers underscore the difficult situation that independent developers — who don’t have the marketing muscle of a major publisher to wade through the digital flood — face when releasing their titles for smartphones.  “Of course, a lot of those [games] will never get noticed, so it’s not like you’re really competing with all [of them],” said Mike Rose, a talent recruiter for SpeedRunners developer TinyBuild. Still, he added, this doesn’t change the fact that developers need to do a lot of legwork just to bring some attention to their games.  The data comes from Rose’s extensive research into indie game sales on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Wii U, 3DS, PC, iOS, and Android — with mobile being the most volatile of them all. He scoured the Internet for postmortem stories and emailed around 100 different indie developers for their insight before presenting his findings at a talk during this year’s Game Developers Conference.  Since free-to-play sales are harder to quantify, the figures (in the picture below) only reflect paid games.  Above: 2.5 million sales or bust. Image Credit: Giancarlo Valdes/GamesBeat  According to Rose, the low-end of the scale comes from developers who had little to no marketing and whose discussions with Google or Apple (for possible storefront promotions) “didn’t get anywhere.” The middle tier benefited from some exposure on the App Store and Google Play as well as from the press and fan discussions on forums. Getting featured on those stores is tough: Apple and Google only promote a handful of games per week.  The coveted 30,000 to 2.5 million sales range are for the rare few that had a ton of exposure or a lot of help from Apple, like when it uses games in commercials or press conferences to help sell more iPhones and iPads.  “You can probably count the number of giant successes on mobile on two hands just from the last year,” said Rose.  He offered a few suggestions for those looking to increase their potential sales: Developers should start talking to Apple and Google early on in development, they should pay constant attention to their games with updates and new downloadable content, and games should launch at a price that leaves room for discounts or price drops in the future.  Though the market looks bleak, the massive audience on mobile (800 million with iOS devices alone) means the struggle might be worth it if developers can figure out how to climb up the top-grossing charts.  “Mobile is super risky, as I’m sure you all know,” Rose said during his concluding remarks. “But it can give you big success if you manage to tick a lot of boxes and get a little bit lucky.”

"Online Marketers Are 21% Sexist … Even When They'Re Women

 Apparently, the tech-industry brogrammer culture has no stranglehold on sexism, as Internet marketers routinely devalue women’s work by an average of 21 percent.  That’s according to search-marketing firm Wordstream , whose CEO Larry Kim just outed his customers’ biases. Kim compared how successful his female colleagues’ work is with how successful his clients perceive them to be. The result is a 21 percent gap between the great work women do and the not-so-great perceptions they suffer from.  This is, of course, the beauty of marketing tech: Everything is measurable.  Kim discovered this while digging deeper into some odd data uncovered during a routine quarterly review of his company’s performance.  “The mean satisfaction score across all reps, for this time slice and segment of clients, was 3.11,” he wrote in a blog post. “Almost all the men had scores above this group average, and all the women had scores below the group average. Further, the male client service rep with the lowest score still did better on the survey than the female client service rep with the higest score.”   Shocked by this data, Kim — who is taking a week’s paternity break for a new child right now — dug deeper, wondering if it was conceivable that all of his female employees were less successful in managing search-marketing campaigns for clients. Suspecting gender bias, he used his company’s own Adwords Grader product to benchmark how each of his accounts was performing and then cross-referenced back to their account rep.  The result? Women are actually better than men at search marketing.  At least, Wordstream’s women.  “The AdWords accounts supported by women at WordStream received Grader scores that were on average, 9 points higher than those managed by men,” Kim reports. “Female account reps received lower scores then male client service reps regardless of the customer’s level of achievement.”  The worst disparities were in average-performing accounts, where clients simultaneously gave male reps the highest scores and female reps the lowest.  Ouch.  You might just suspect this is the result of some aged dinosaurs still roaming this planet — aka male chauvinists. The truth is worse than that. In fact, it appears that it’s not just men who are sexist, but women are sexist against … other women.  “The gender bias was actually more dramatic among female clients, who scored female reps by an average of .82 points lower than they would male reps, compared to .43 lower score by male clients,” Kim says.   That evaluation gap contributes to a salary gap of about 20 percent industry-wide, according to recent data.  And it shows that even in the traditionally female-friendly marketing sector, women have a long way to go — even among themselves — to fight internalized sexism.  It also brings a new challenge to HR problems, Kim told me via email.  “Knowing that the bias is there, I can’t really use this customer satisfaction data to make data-driven decisions about hiring or promotions – and if I do, I have to factor in the 21 percent ‘Gender Valuation Handicap’ that we uncovered.”

"Bnter Brings Conversation Sharing App To Android Phones, Launches Bookmarklet

We’re big fans of Bnter , an app that allows you to share your conversations with others publicly. The same way you share photos via the web or your mobile phone, Bnter allows you to share snippets of conversations you have with friends on the web. While the startup initially focused on SMS, Bnter recently broadened its scope to allow users to share any sort of conversation, including GChat, in-person chat, email and more. Today, Bnter is launching a free Android app (which joins an existing iPhone app) and is launching a bookmarklet, and in-depth Twitter integration The Android app (which works on OS 2.1 or higher) is similar in functionality to its iPhone cousin and the web app, and allows you to read your feed of conversations and people you are following, comment, search and add conversations. And because it is a mobile app, Bnter for Android can pull your text message stream into the app so posting is fairly easy. Bnter’s new bookmarklet, which you can download here, allows for posting conversations directly from open chats in GChat, Facebook Chat, Foursquare comments, GroupMe, Twitter and Campfire to your Bnter profile. Bnter, which has raised seed funding from a number of high-profile investors including Founder Collective and SV Angel, has also added a feature for automatic Twitter import of mentions on the service. Bnter users easily post Twitter conversations by linking their Twitter account to Bnter,  and can review all conversations in a drafts folder before deciding to post the most interesting ones to Bnter. For the New York Based startup, this release has been somewhat of a challenge. As Sarah Lacy wrote last week, Spark Capital reportedly reneged on a termsheet offered to Bnter, forcing the bootstrapped startup to take some drastic measures (for example, co-founder Lauren Leto isn’t taking a salary) to continue the release and product development. It just goes to show that despite certain hardships and bumps in the road,  founders’ passion for their ideas can help sustain a startup in the most trying situations. Also, you can see Leto explain why she founded Bnter in this recent Founder Stories clip.

"Dreamhost Hacked, Password Changes Made Mandatory

Another day, another hack. The company whose data was compromised this time? DreamHost. According to DreamHost’s status blog , the company detected “unauthorized activity within one of [their] databases”. In other words: someone was snooping around where they shouldn’t have been snooping, and DreamHost noticed the foot prints. Alas, the company isn’t divulging much information as to the nature of the hack, beyond that they “don’t have evidence that customer passwords were taken at this time”. Still, they’re requiring password resets for all Shell/FTP accounts (read: not the account that DreamHost customers use to login to the billing/backend system, but the user accounts they use to access and maintain their actual websites.) for what seems to be all DreamHost customers. If you find yourself having trouble logging into your DreamHost FTP accounts today, it’s because your password has already been disabled. Perhaps it goes without saying, but: If you’re a DreamHost customer and you use a similar password elsewhere around the Internet, now’s the time to switch them all up.

"A Shark Attack Convinced Me That Sony’S Project Morpheus Makes Virtual Reality Work

 SAN FRANCISCO — I received an ominous warning before strapping on Project Morpheus, Sony’s new virtual-reality headset for the PlayStation 4 home console.  “If you think you might get motion sickness using Project Morpheus, let us know now,” a Sony rep said.  I do get motion sick pretty easily, but I didn’t want to tell that attendant that. Before I knew it, I was donning Morpheus, which Sony announced yesterday at the 2014 Game Developer Conference.  From the start, it’s clear that Morpheus is a work-in-progress. Compared to its nearest competitor — the Oculus Rift — it looks rougher and feels less comfortable. The screen is also blurrier, making it akin to gazing out through a dirty window.  But then the shark arrived, and any complaints I had about the screen quality vanished. Standing in a steel cage, I watched apprehensively as the massive great white flitted in and out of the shadows before charging the cage, giving me a close-up view of teeth that looked like steak knives. Looking into that maw, I totally forgot that I was wearing an uncomfortable headset and that the cage wasn’t really shaking all around me. In that moment, I finally “got” VR in a way that has eluded me until now.  While I didn’t truly feel what I would call “fear” — I was very much aware that I was in a simulation — I felt a level of immersion that I’ve never experienced in a game before. Until now, the distance between myself and the screen has always created a natural sense of removal from the action. With Morpheus, that sense of removal is mostly gone. I knew it wasn’t real, but the lizard portion of my brain was still screaming, “That’s a shark!” It was definitely a unique experience.   I’ll still admit to being a VR skeptic even after playing with Morpheus and the Rift. Despite the novelty of coming face-to-face with a Great White and the immersion inherent to the experience , I have a hard time imagining anyone outside of hardcore gamers donning one of those unwieldy headsets on a regular basis.  Yes, I’ll admit to being a VR skeptic even after playing with Morpheus and the Rift. Even now, I have a hard time imagining anyone outside of hardcore gamers donning one of those unwieldy headsets on a regular basis.  Nevertheless, I think Sony’s VR headset has a few crucial things going for it, a big one being that the DualShock 4 and PlayStation Move controllers for the PS4 are both really well suited for VR. Once the helmet was on my head, both of them felt like a natural extension of my arm, which was particularly surprising for the DualShock 4. I was kind of expecting a controller designed for two hands to feel kind of awkward being held out in one, but that was not the case.  The other thing that Morpheus has going for it is the simple fact that it’s on a console. With the right price and the right software, it’s easy to imagine it catching on as a PlayStation 4 peripheral. It feels more substantial than either 3D television or the Move, Sony’s original foray into motion control. This is a thing that game developers can really embrace as a new medium, provided of course that they are willing to take a few risks and allocate their resources accordingly.  I ended up seeing two demos at the Morpheus booth. The second one was a relatively simple demonstration called “The Castle” in which I put on a pair of disembodied gloves and swung a sword at a dummy. I’ll admit that it was pretty cool to point and aim a crossbow in the way that I had once imagined myself doing with the Wii, Nintendo’s first motion-controlled console, but the shark is definitely what stuck with me after the demo.  Unfortunately, it was also the first moment that I felt that familiar twinge of nausea and thought, “It doesn’t matter how immersive VR turns out to be. If I end up getting sick any time I use it, it really might not be for me.” To be fair, I think some of my motion sickness is down to Morpheus’ slightly slower head-tracking.  It’s the early days yet for Morpheus — Sony hasn’t even finalized its specs — and I expect the company will sand down a lot of the rough edges in the future. At least I hope so. If people like me end up upchucking every time we don that headset for longer than 15 minutes, Sony will have a problem on its hands.  Otherwise, Sony is off to a strong start with virtual reality. Even at this early stage, Morpheus easily bests what the original Rift VR headset had to offer and comes close to matching the updated Oculus development kit as well.  If Sony’s shark is a sign of things to come, I expect big things in Morpheus’s future.

"Adobe Flash 10.1 To Support Just About Every Mobile Os (Except The Iphone'S)

Adobe took the wraps off its latest and most versatile version of its Flash Player to date earlier today. The newly announced Flash 10.1 software will be available “for smartphones, smartbooks, netbooks, PCs and other Internet-connected devices, allowing content created using the Adobe Flash Platform to reach users wherever they are.” It’s kind of a big deal. Version 10.1 represents the first Flash iteration that will work on just about any computing device floating around meatspace. More importantly (at least to us) is the freshly announced support for just about every mobile OS platform on the market, except you know whose (more on that below). According to the official release : In other words, by the end of Q1 2010, we should see Flash running on WinMo, webOS, Android, Symbian, and BlackBerry mobile devices. This is pretty huge. Regardless of what anyone thinks about Flash, it has clearly become a major Web standard over the years. Its presence has been noticeably absent from mobile browsers, forcing developers to create workarounds or avoid including particular features from their mobile sites all together. But with 10.1, these issues should become history. Not to mention, the upcoming Flash Player has purportedly been designed to maximize today’s (and tomorrow’s) cutting-edge mobile hardware. However, once all the dust had settled earlier this morning, there was still one mobile platform that had not yet joined the party – iPhone OS. But then again, we already knew that to be the case . Until Apple learns to play nice with others (er, at least Adobe), it should no longer claim to offer access to the “full Internet” via its iDevices. In any case, like any new hardware or software claims made these days, the jury is definitely still out until we see some solid evidence to support Adobe’s puffery. The promise of mobile access to “virtually all Flash technology based Web content and applications wherever they are” sounds fantastic. Now we’ll just have to wait and see. For more, check out Adobe’s demo vids or take a spin through their new FAQ .

"Mark Pincus Rings Nasdaq’S Opening Bell; Zynga Stock Trades Begin

 Zynga chief executive Mark Pincus rang the opening bell — in a virtual way, from Zynga’s headquarters in San Francisco — as trading began for Zynga’s initial public offering today.  Zynga’s opening trades for its offering of $1 billion at $10 a share are about to begin. The overall stock market is trading up this morning, so the company picked a good day.  Pincus rang the opening bell along with board member Bing Gordon and Pincus’s wife, Alison Pincus. Watching them was a horde of employees at the company’s headquarters in San Francisco.  “We thought about the logistics of taking you to New York,” Pincus said. “So we brought the Nasdaq here.”  He added, “With our ipo, we are accelerating this mission of connecting the world through games. There is a lot of energy around our company. And what we need to do is focus that back on our mission and get regrounded in our mission of making games we love to play.”  Zynga is the biggest IPO in gaming history and the biggest tech IPO since Google went public in 2004. The social game company has 230 million monthly active users.  The experience of creating Zynga “renewed my faith in the power of venture capitalists,” he said. “Bing Gordon and John Doerr are here today, and they have been an inspiration to this whole company.  Other social game companies are glad to see Zynga finally going public after first filing for the IPO in July. As we chronicled in our extensive history of the company, Zynga has come a long way since chief executive Mark Pincus founded the company in 2007. His tale is sure to inspire other entrepreneurs.  The company reported net income of $12.5 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, down 54 percent from $27 million a year ago, according to an updated S1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The performance isn’t stellar, but it’s not so bad as to suggest Zynga’s planned initial public offering is in trouble.  Revenue was $307 million in the quarter, up 80 percent from $170.6 million a year ago. In other words, Zynga is working harder for the profits it gets by generating a lot more revenue compared to the past.  In the second quarter, Zynga reported only $1.4 million in profits on $280 million in revenue, so the third quarter report is an improvement on a quarter-to-quarter basis.  Arvind Bhatia, an analyst at Sterne Agee, published a report on Tuesday initiating coverage of Zynga with an “underperform” rating that put Zynga’s price at about $7 a share.  That price is equivalent to about 11 times 2012 estimated EBITDA (earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization). That gives Zynga a 30 percent price premium relative to its peer group, meaning it is viewed as one of the leaders of its pack.  A similar social gaming company, Nexon, went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Wednesday, with a pre-trading market capitalization of $7 billion, although it closed the day down about 3 percent off its IPO price. The Asian online gaming giant raised $1.2 billion and made net income of $260.1 million, up 14 percent, on revenue of $853.5 million, up 26.5 percent, for the nine months ended Sept. 30.  BTIG also wrote a report on Zynga on Wednesday morning that said investors should participate in the Zynga IPO within the $8.50 to $10 a share price range. The research firm’s analysts Richard Greenfield and Brandon Ross wrote that they believe Zynga’s social games are a cure for boredom, much like TV, and can be played anywhere. They said that Zynga is a “media company” focused on taking a greater share of your time and money spent on entertainment. They said Zynga’s growth will be driven by launches across more game platforms, with a powerful network effect. They see continued growth of social networking beyond 1 billion users, with both Zynga and Facebook benefiting.  Pincus said, “We founded this company on a few premises. That there should be free games for everyone in the world to play. And you guys, our shareholders and employees, should be able to lead and share in the success of the company. I’m proud we did that.”

"Is There Any Morality In Sitting On Your Couch And Playing Virtual Soldier?

We’re just about two weeks away from the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops , and besides the fact that it’s yet another Call of Duty game (which usually means a decent multi-player mode, and a campaign of varying quality), there’s not a whole lot of “heat” surrounding it. Yes, it’s setting all sorts of pre-order records , and the critical reaction is already largely positive ( PSM3 magazine calls it “2010’s top shooter” in its December issue), but there’s no real, I don’t know, excitement surrounding it. That’s my perception, at least. Could it be that Medal of Honor , with its Taliban-infused multi-player, has already exhausted this country’s supply of outrage? Foreign Affairs has published an article that asks a simple question (the best questions are simple ones): Is the new crop of hyperrealistic military video games driving home the reality of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, or simply exploiting them? As you know, EA went to great lengths to convince people that Medal of Honor wasn’t so much about the war in Afghanistan, which is a fairly complicated matter to address in a relatively short single-player campaign, as much as it was the soldiers themselves. You know, pay no attention to the fact that this is a war that’s happening right now , and just focus on the bonds soldiers make with each other—a common refrain in the previous Medal of Honor games. But if all EA wanted to do was create a game that’s sympathetic to soldiers, did it really need to create a game based on the ongoing conflict on Afghanistan? Call of Duty 4 carefully skirted this controversy by setting the campaign in an imaginary country, and by not specifically labeling “the bad guys” with a real world name. The Foreign Affairs article charts the history of such games. The first Medal of Honor, which came out in 1999, was the game that kick-started the video game industry’s obsession with World War II shooters. Next to zombies, Nazis are the easiest, most guilt-free targets you can ask for. (Though I suppose you can argue your plain ol’ German soldier wasn’t necessarily a Nazi, but that’s neither here nor there.) But after years and years (and years) of shooting Nazis, apparently gamers became bored. In steps Call of Duty 4, set in a reasonable facsimile of a “modern war,” and here we have the next craze: modern shooters, which can be boiled down to this: There’s no “meat” to these games, so why go out of your way to set them in a “real” environment if no “real” concerns are addressed? It does nothing but generate accusations of exploitation. What’s funny is that the best multi-player shooter out there today, Valve’s Team Fortress 2, is about as unrealistic as you can get. You don’t see military mothers on Fox News complaining about its graphic depiction of violence, do you? It’s RED versus BLU, and you’re essentially controlling cartoon characters. So why push people’s buttons so needlessly?

"Andrew Grill, Full Disclosure, And Influencing The Influencers – Vb Engage

 We know a cash cow when we see one, and we’re going to bleed this subject dry. That’s a promise.  Yes — that’s right. In this episode of VB Engage, we continue the discussion around chatbots, as news comes in that Facebook Messenger now has 11,000 chatbots available for artificial conversations.  There’s just one problem. How on earth do you know what bots are available, what they do, and how people rate them? Travis and Stewart discuss this very real issue in the news segment before digging in to the sometimes murky world of influencer marketing with Andrew Grill, former CEO of Kred and current head of social consulting at IBM.     We also discuss the “Do Not Pay” bot, which has beaten over 160,000 traffic tickets in London and is now coming to a city near you. It challenged 250,000 tickets in total and overturned 160,000 of them. That’s a 64 percent success rate, and the bot has saved Londoners around £4 million. If this is the future, sign us up.  There’s only one issue with the current bot crop — humor. Stewart thinks there is a great market for brands and chatbot creators to employ real comedians, because right now, chatbots are full of “dad jokes” and bad puns.  Finally, we get into Twitter’s apps: Dashboard and Engage. And no — they didn’t ask us if they could use the name “Engage” for their app. Travis wonders if Twitter has app envy, since Facebook and LinkedIn have multiple apps, too. And Stewart is concerned about ease-of-use, something Twitter needs to get a grip on.  Speaking of social, we talk at length with Andrew Grill about social media engagement, influence, big issues with disclosure, and how mobile devices are changing everything in that space. After all, smartphones are the most personal of all devices, so we ask Andrew how they affect employees’ willingness to share company content.  In fact, we discuss everything from employee advocacy to how brands use social media in broadcast mode to how to become an influencer.  You need to be consistent in your messages. If you talk about a bunch of different topics, no one will know what you’re known for. – Andrew Grill  According to Andrew, you need to have a clear point of view. And you need to have exclusive content too — not the same old advice that everyone else touts. Have that, and people will be drawn to you.  Big thanks to Andrew Grill for joining us. And if you missed last week, make sure to listen to Talia Wolf share wisdom around conversion optimization. Next week, tune in for a great interview with Scott Brinker, the godfather of marketing technology.

"Intel, Yahoo And Hp Cloud Computing Collaboration Open Cirrus Expands Global Footprint

Open Cirrus, the joint collaboration on cloud computing research formed by Yahoo, Intel and HP last year, has added three new international research organizations to join the open source test bed for cloud computing research. The new research organizations that are joining Open Cirrus, include the Russian Academy of Sciences, South Korea’s Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute and MIMOS, a strategic research and development organization under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation in Malaysia. Launched in July 2008, Open Cirrus was created by the three tech giants to promote open collaboration among industry, academia and governments by removing the financial and logistical barriers to research in data-intensive, Internet-scale computing. The test bed, which has more than 50 research projects currently underway, simulates a real-life, global, Internet-scale environment and lets researchers test applications and measure the performance of applications and services that are built to run on large-scale cloud systems. As we wrote last year, the Open Cirrus is a way for Yahoo to get its foot in the cloud computing space and a channel for Intel and HP to further their position as leaders in cloud computing technology. It should be interesting to see what innovations come out of the collaboration.

"Meet The Robot Enforcer: The Husqvarna Dxr 310 Demolition Robot

I for one welcome our new robot overlords .. And I have the sinking feeling that this particular robot will be the enforcer of the group. It’s a damn good thing that the Cylons didn’t have one of these, or it would have just chewed through the side of the Galactica and made for a very short series. All kidding aside, the Husq.. Husqv.. the DXR 310 is a industrial demolition robot designed to work in hard to reach, or just plain dangerous areas. Everything is controlled hydraulically, but it’s actually powered by an electric motor. This self-propelled robot also has a variety of attachments, like jack hammers, scoops, and claws. This means it can tear through pretty much anything the operator (who controls it remotely) wants to. No idea how much it costs, I suspect if you have to ask, you can’t afford it. [via Red Ferret ]

"Comcast Fires Employees For P2P Discussions

Comcast employees are on lockdown with the recent storm of controversy regarding accusations that the ISP is throttling Bit Torrent traffic. Those in Comcast’s support department is finding out that if you let customers know their traffic is being modified, you will lose your job. Customer support reps are supposed to stick to a script and if asked about “the situation”, lie through their teeth to customers. Shame on you, Comcast. Also, if you work for Comcast, don’t talk to us or anyone else.  Speaking to the media will also result in termination of your job. Want the juicy goods? Hit the jump for an e-mail from an IP support manager: Word on the ‘net is that the ISP is using Sandvine ‘s technology to block BitTorrent traffic. I used to be a Comcast customer for years and truth be told, I never had a ton of problems. In fact, I’ve got more beef with my current provider, Time Warner Cable.

"Universal Will Still Supply Apple With Music

The other day, people started getting freaky because Universal Music Group stated it was not renewing its iTunes contract with Apple. Everyone, myself included, took it as a sign that UMG would be pulling out of iTunes altogether and that millions of available songs would be lost forever. Luckily, that’s not the case. After realizing the public flipped out about the statement, Universal decided to downplay the situation a bit, saying that it will continue to offer music on iTunes, just not on the old terms it previously agreed to with Apple. The new deal allows UMG to charge more for exclusive pre-releases of albums, meaning Apple is going to have to fork out more cash for those iTunes Exclusives. Hopefully we won’t see a price increase in iTunes tracks anytime soon. Universal downgrades kneecapping to kick in nuts [The Register]

"The Nsa’S Massive Utah Data Center Won’T Store Anything Close To Yottabytes Of Data

A stunning report in Forbes today detailed that the NSA’s rapidly completing data center in Utah will not hold as much data as was originally suspected. If you are at all worried about the power of the NSA, this is good news for you. The gist of the Forbes report is that, given the allotted space for digital storage equipment, the center’s four main buildings simply cannot store as much information as has been discussed in the popular media. Here’s Wired in 2012 describing what the facility and its potential brethren will be capable of holding: Wired is referring to the fact that a yottabyte is the largest storage term we have, not that septillion is the highest numerical descriptor for a large figure in existence , if you were confused. But what about that yottabyte claim? Is the NSA really building that level of capacity? Not at the Utah data center alone, that is unless the government has managed to create new storage technology on a size efficiency scale that Internet giants would salivate over. Using more market-based analysis given the 100,000 square feet of space in the Utah collection of data centers, estimates as collected by Forbes from various experts range from 3 to 12 exabytes. This pales painfully next to the former claim of a yottabyte, and stands in frank contrast to the idea that the center could store 5 zettabytes of information. How far off were the estimates that we were fed before? Taking an unkind view of the yottabyte idea, let’s presume that it was the implication that the center could hold the lowest number of yottabytes possible to be plural: 2. The smaller, and likely most reasonable, claim of 3 exabytes of storage at the center is directly comparable. Now, let’s dig into the math a bit and see just how far off early estimates were. Stacked side by side, it would take 666,666 3-exabyte units of storage to equal 2 yottabytes. That’s because a yottabyte is 1,000 zettabytes, each of which contain 1,000 exabytes. So, a yottabyte is 1 million exabytes. The ratio of 2:3 in our example of yottabytes and exabytes is applied, and we wrap with a 666,666:1 ratio. I highlight that fact, as the idea that the Utah data center might hold yottabytes has been bandied about as if it was logical. It’s not, given the space available for servers and the like. The practical implication of this fact is that the NSA, and larger U.S. government, doesn’t have the ability to store data on the scale that many previously feared. This means that information collected either via PRISM-like programs or through direct tapping of fiber cables cannot be stored as long as previously thought and that there are material restrictions on what the government can intercept. This is not to say that the NSA doesn’t want to collect and store more. It does. The Utah data center is proof of that fact. That in mind, technology doesn’t appear to have reached a scale of miniaturization to allow for the scale of data storage that unsettled many in a single installation. However, as with all things technology, the cure is up and to the right. What the NSA can’t do now, it will certainly be able to do in a half decade. Repeat this to yourself: You have no digital privacy . Top Image Credit: daveynin

"Introducing Pocket: Read It Later Gets A Makeover With A New Name And Redesigned Apps

  See you later, Read It Later . The bookmarking app for web, Android, and iOS just changed its name to Pocket and launched redesigned versions of its apps.  Read It Later was originally designed to save articles on websites and social media sites to read later, hence the name. I’ve used the app for ages to save articles that I find at work, so I can read them in bed on my iPad or on my public transit ride home.  Despite its original intentions, Read It Later founder Nate Weiner discovered that 40 percent of the content saved with his service consists of videos, recipes, and webpages.  “We are embracing what our users are already doing with the app. People aren’t just saving articles and they don’t need a separate app for watch it later and buy it later,” Weiner told VentureBeat in an interview.  The company wanted to send a clear message that its service isn’t just for saving articles. The name Pocket is meant to convey that you can save anything for later, put it on your mobile device, and take in with you in your pocket. The “Read It Later” buttons in many social and content apps will be renamed “save to Pocket,” which to me just doesn’t have the same ring to it.  To go along with the name change, Read It Later is updating its apps with a different look. Instead of the black and yellow motif I’ve grown used to, Pocket has a beige theme with sea-foam green, teal, coral, and tangerine accents. And like nearly everything these days, the app adopts a Pinterest-like tile view option, which shows pictures from the content you save, if available.  Read It Later’s old interface was hardly problematic, but the new version is smooth and easy to use. You can favorite posts to find them later and bulk-archive posts, two new features. The company also did away with free and paid versions and is offering one free app for Android, iOS, and the Amazon Kindle Fire.  Read It Later and now Pocket, competes with Instapaper , a very similar content bookmarking service. Both Instapaper and Read It Later let you read saved content on your phone or tablet without an Internet connection. Apple’s Safari browser has the Reading List function , which also bookmarks articles and webpages to read later.  The service has gained significant traction, recording 200 million items saved as of March 2012. Weiner threw out the stat that five items were saved every second during our interview. And analytics from the company claim that it’s the second most popular share destination on content curation app Zite, beating out social networks Twitter and Facebook, and its competitor Instapaper.  Founded in 2007, San Francisco-based Read It Later has raised $2.5 million from Foundation Capital, Baseline Ventures, Founder Collective, and Google Ventures. The company has five employees.

"Enjoy Brings Its Tech Delivery And Concierge Service To Los Angeles

 Enjoy is expanding into its third city, bringing the technology delivery and setup service to Los Angeles with plans already set to launch next in Chicago. This expansion phase comes nearly a year after operations began in San Francisco and New York.  Started by former Apple retail executive Ron Johnson, Enjoy specializes in not only delivering you the latest technology devices, but ensuring that you have a great experience setting them up and that you undertand how they work. Instead of simply delivering a device  (including iPhone, Sonos, iPad, Apple TV, GoPro, camera, drone, or game console), an “expert” will take the time to teach you how to use it.  Now Enjoy is in Los Angeles, and the service is available in not only the city proper, but also from Santa Monica to Glendale and up into the San Fernando Valley.  And while the company has been slowly adding more products to its lineup, it’s also integrating with partners, such as Ecobee, Boosted, and Devialet, all of which have incorporated Enjoy’s API into their sites, giving customers the option to have an “expert” deliver their items. Enjoy has also launched a deal with American Express, whereby cardholders can use their membership rewards points to shop at Enjoy within the American Express Member Rewards shopping portal.  Customer experience is the company’s primary focus, especially as Enjoy strives to set itself apart from TaskRabbit, Postmates, and other delivery services. Enjoy touts the fact that its “experts” arrive on time or early to their appointments 98 percent of the time. Additionally, all of its staff are contracted as full-time employees, meaning that Enjoy doesn’t utilize 1099 contractor workers, opting instead to provide full benefits.  You can read about our experience using Enjoy when we had an iPhone 6s delivered to our office.  Enjoy has raised $80 million in funding to date from Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Highland Capital Partners, and Oak Investment Partners.

"Apple Should Just Buy Duckduckgo

 Apple creates great products, but struggles to do the same for Internet services. One of the most important, hardest-to-build, and useful Internet services of our day is the search engine.  The top search engines are all either owned by Apple’s direct competitors, or are failing to keep up with innovations from Google and to a lesser extent, Microsoft. Apple needs a search engine that respects user privacy, is already familiar with the company’s products, and can help the company take on the likes of Google Now and Cortana.  Thankfully, a search engine that just happens to be the perfect fit for Apple already exists: DuckDuckGo .  It’s all about privacy  Apple has championed user privacy for a long time, but over the past few months it has been especially declarative about its stance. The company is increasingly positioning itself as the anti-Google and the anti-Facebook.  The timing isn’t a coincidence. Privacy concerns are at an all-time high , and Apple’s policies are not going unnoticed . Neither are DuckDuckGo’s: The search engine’s traffic has grown 600 percent over the past two years.  Apple put its money where its mouth is a long while ago, and now the mouth is doing a lot of talking. Just this month alone, Apple has gone out of its way to criticize competitors that rely on user data as well as to promote itself as the privacy-conscious tech leader.  “I’m speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at EPIC’s Champions of Freedom event in Washington. “They’re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think that’s wrong. And it’s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.”  The message was clear: Apple thinks you should be in control of your own information. This missive came up again less than a week later at WWDC.  Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, emphasized that Apple does all its data processing on-device, and whatever it gleans from that never gets uploaded. Queries made to Apple’s servers are kept anonymous , not tied to an Apple ID and not shared with third parties.  All of this jibes well with what DuckDuckGo believes and does. From the search engine’s privacy section on its about page : “What you search for is your own business and we’d like to keep it that way. That’s why we don’t collect any personal information and therefore, have none to share.”  A partnership already exists  Last year, Apple partnered with DuckDuckGo , adding the search engine as an option in Safari. While DuckDuckGo is not the default, the move made it possible for OS X and iOS users to switch their search engine to DuckDuckGo with just a few clicks.  DuckDuckGo celebrated the addition by pointing to an OS X Yosemite preview page on Apple’s website:  @rustybrick Check out “New features to protect your privacy” here: http://t.co/7T8XGDMMkq :)  — DuckDuckGo (@duckduckgo) June 2, 2014   Just one sentence summed up the deal: “You can also now search the web using DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn’t track you.” That’s as great of a compliment as any company will ever get out of Apple.  “The terms are confidential,” DuckDuckGo’s CEO and founder Gabriel Weinberg told Marketing Land when asked if there was any paid component to the arrangement. “Needless to say, though, DuckDuckGo is thrilled to be included in Safari.”  That Yosemite preview page doesn’t exist anymore, but Apple does have a new privacy page . “DuckDuckGo allows you to search the web without being tracked, and Safari is the first browser to offer it as a built-in option,” it states.  Apple needs a search engine  Apple wouldn’t gain much if it suddenly started to compete directly in the search engine space. It doesn’t have to take on Google, Bing, or Yahoo on the desktop Web. It doesn’t even have to focus on the mobile Web.  Apple simply needs a backbone for the future of search: context, context, and context. People increasingly want more than just search results — they want answers to their questions.  Right now, that means digital assistants. Siri is far from perfect, and Apple is already planning to improve it with iOS 9’s proactive assistant . In Apple’s announcement earlier this month at WWDC, however, there was very little the company showed that we had never seen before. Google Now, and even in many cases Microsoft’s Cortana, can already do much of what the company showed.  Apple is playing catch up, and that’s largely due to the fact that it doesn’t have a search engine to call its own. That means a lack of conversational understanding : The more data Google and Microsoft collect about the world, and the better their search engines become at making sense of it all, the better experience those companies can offer to their users. Without collecting data, Apple will have a hard time matching these experiences.  And that better experience doesn’t just affect digital assistants. It has broad implications for all parts of the operating system, especially on mobile. Apple knows that, and that’s why it is pushing forward with its proactive assistant.  Even though DuckDuckGo respects user privacy, it still learns and improves its results based on what users search for. Apple can take that data and use it to improve more than just search results.  Final thoughts  While an acquisition makes a lot of sense, like any deal, there would be problems. Apple would have to make difficult decisions on how much support, financial resources, and other considerations to give to DuckDuckGo.  Apple has deep enough pockets to compete directly with Google, Bing, and Yahoo. That said, it likely wouldn’t want to. There is certainly a lot of money to be made in search, even if it’s not comparable to Apple’s margins, but there’s arguably less money to be made in private search.  In addition to DuckDuckGo’s various partnerships , Apple would also have to take over the problems that come with offering and maintaining a search engine. That means a lot of regional issues, like Europe’s ongoing “ right to be forgotten ” brouhaha, as well as censorship and outright bans. In September, for example, DuckDuckGo was blocked in China , an increasingly critical market for Apple, out of the blue.  If Apple were to buy DuckDuckGo, it couldn’t immediately make the service the default search engine in its operating systems. After all, the company still receives a significant amount of money from its Google partnership.  But after some work to improve the service further, it could definitely do that. The search deal that makes Google the default search engine in Apple’s operating systems is worth billions, and it’s up for renewal this year .  There has been a lot of speculation around Apple ditching Google for Bing or Yahoo, but the truth is none of those options is ideal. Google is still the king of search, and while a large part of that is because of its expertise and size, a lot also has to do with brand loyalty .  DuckDuckGo is a cute name, but it’s long to type in and definitely doesn’t feel like something Apple would dream up. iSearch and iFind could have been options a few years ago, or even iGo would be quite straightforward.  Given that we are now in the era of Apple Pay, Apple Watch, and Apple Music however, it only follows that Apple Search would be the logical name. In the interest of a short name, and one that also merges the two brands, we’d love if it were called Apple Go.

"Apple Might Make A Handheld Game Console And/Or Make A Robotic Monkey To Fetch Your Colostomy Bag

Apple just trademarked some sort of weird logo for a hand-held gaming rig which everyone is speculating is actually some sort of very exciting Apple-branded handheld game system that will work with iTunes and be the best thing in the world. What I really think is going on here is that Apple is trademarking a logo for when some crazy Chinese pirate company starts making “Apple” branded game units or this has already happened and they’re just doing due diligence. Chances of an Apple game console? Slim to 5%. Apple [TradeMork]

"The Original Alien Cast Reunites For Isolation — But Only If You Preorder

 Alien: Isolation’s creepy, survival-focused adventure already looks like a great homage to the famous horror movie Alien , but some new missions actually bring back the original cast to recreate moments from that iconic sci-fi masterpiece.  You’re going to need to preorder the game, however, if you want to play them.  “Working with the original cast has been an incredible experience,” said Alistair Hope, creative lead on Alien: Isolation, in a press release sent to GamesBeat. “It was important to us to have the key original cast members reprise their roles in order to perfectly capture the atmosphere of the movie. For some of the original cast, this is their first appearance in an Alien video game. Seeing them reprise those roles after 35 years was an unforgettable experience.” (Listen to Hope talk about the classic film and how it influenced the game in this exclusive commentary audio track .)  The returning cast includes Sigourney Weaver (Ellen Ripley), Tom Skerritt (Dallas), Veronica Cartwright (Lambert), Harry Dean Stanton (Brett), and Yaphet Kotto (Parker). It also uses Ian Holm’s likeness for the cyborg Ash, although a soundalike will record the dialogue.  Anyone who preorders Alien: Isolation will get the “Crew Expendable” mission, which lets players take control of Ripley, Dallas, or Parker during the xenomorph’s takeover of the Nostromo spaceship. Those who preorder specifically from retailer GameStop also get the “Last Survivor” mission, which features Ripley during the climatic self-destruct sequence from the original Alien .  We reached out to Sega to ask if it was possible to play these missions without preordering and are waiting for a response.

"Solarve: Sanyo Shows World'S First Solar Cell-Equipped Bus

Sanyo in Japan today announced [JP] what it says is the world’s first solar-cell-equipped public bus, the Solarve (which stands for Solar Vehicle). The bus was unveiled to commemorate the 100th anniversary of a Japanese transportation and logistics company called Ryobi [JP]. The Solarve is essentially a city bus with solar cells on top that generate power for its interior LED lights. Sanyo says the solar panels atop the diesel-electric hybrid bus are good for a total output of 798 watts (420W through crystalline silicon cells, and the rest through amorphous silicon cells). When the sun isn’t shining for an extended period of time, power will be supplied by storage batteries inside the bus for about nine hours. The Solarve is expected to be first used as early as September 1 (in Okayama City in Southern Japan).

"Keen On….The Three Winners Of The At&T Hackathon: Innovation, Innovation And Innovation

 As Michael Mandel of the Progressive Policy Institute noted in a recent report about “scale and innovation”, today’s digital economy favors large companies because growth depends to the establishment of ecosystems built around operating systems like Android or iPhone. But it’s not just large new media companies like Google and Apple that can benefit from these large ecosystems; older, more established media and technology companies like Verizon, Pearson, Comcast, Time Warner and AT&T also have this same advantage over smaller start-ups to radically innovate through their extensive ecosystems. The innovative strength of AT&T ecosystem was demonstrated earlier this week at CES during their Hackathon – an event that attracted over 150 developers to create apps built on the AT&T mobile network. The three Hackathon finalists, who I interviewed after the results were announced, including the ultimate winner Active X-Ray which deployed the mobile network’s mHealth API to create an injury evaluation mobile app, off AT&T’s mHealth platform . But AT&T’s ecosystem goes beyond the security and richness of their APIs. Not only did the two San Diego based developers behind Active X-Ray win $20,000, but they also won the opportunity to build out their app at the AT&T Foundry in Palo Alto, one of the new innovation centers that they have opened to enable developers and entrepreneurs to partner in the AT&T ecosystem. Tomorrow, we will broadcast my interview with the Palo Alto based People Power , the very impressive winner of AT&T’s $20,000 Power The Future mobility app competition.

"Grand Theft Auto V Hits 33M Units Sold, Or Almost $2B In Retail Sales

 Take-Two Interactive Software reported today that it has sold more than 33 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V since its launch last September. That means the game has generated an estimated $1.98 billion in retail sales.  Take-Two said that GTA V was the best-selling console game in 2013 in North America, Latin America, and Europe. The open world mayhem game was the fastest to reach $1 billion in sales in video game history, said Strauss Zelnick, chairman of New York-based Take-Two.  Take-Two’s Rockstar Games developed the game over five years at an estimated cost of $260 million. Rockstar launched Grand Theft Auto Online in October, and then it proceeded to release a number of updates for it, including The Business Update, The High Life Update, and The Valentines Day Massacre Special.  It has also released Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for Kindle, Android, and Windows Phone devices.  Of the $1.98 billion, not all of the amount goes to Take-Two, as retailers take their cut. But the sales are impressive, considering that Take-Two generated just $2.4 billion in revenues during its fiscal year.  In an analyst call, Zelnick said that GTA Online was the biggest contributor to digital sales and revenues from it were unexpectedly high. He said Rockstar provided tools for gamers to develop their own content, and 7 million pieces of content have been created to date.  Zelnick said that Rockstar is hard at work on unannounced next-generation console games that will be launched during the current fiscal year. He said that Rockstar will be about 45 percent of this year’s revenues, but he declined to say what Rockstar’s new games are. He noted that Rockstar has not announced whether it will present any games at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) trade show in June. Rockstar usually doesn’t exhibit at E3.

"Start-Up Chile Launches Follow-On Fund To Boost Local Growth

Editor’s Note : Christine Magee is an editor for CrunchBase. Shortly after launching Start-Up Chile , the state-backed accelerator program designed to spur the development of a startup ecosystem in Chile, the Chilean government realized they had a problem on their hands. The program was running smoothly, but a dearth of local investors was driving a good portion of its graduates to a premature death. Five years later, Start-Up Chile has devised a solution to this problem — it will fund the startups itself, through a follow-on fund launching today called Start-Up Chile SCALE. Start-Up Chile has graduated over 1000 startups from its accelerator program that offers entrepreneurs $40k in equity-free financing to temporarily relocate to Santiago, Chile. These companies have gone on to raise hundreds of millions in follow-on funding, generating a massive amount of press for the program and for Chile’s budding tech scene. But the project has faced its fair share of challenges. You can relocate hundreds of international entrepreneurs to Chile, fly in dozens of experienced mentors, and hand out stacks of government money to everyone, but building a startup ecosystem from scratch takes time. “That’s why we created the SCALE fund,” says Sebastian Vidal, director of Start-Up Chile. “85% of the funds that Start-Up Chile companies have raised — which is like 110 million so far — is capital from abroad, the majority from the States.” For startups based in Chile, it’s difficult to find early stage capital to sustain a business that’s not yet profitable. Latin America is home to a different breed of venture investor than your typical Silicon Valley seed fund —these guys tend to expect an unrealistic demonstration of traction before they’ll place a bet on a young company. As a result, startups often jump ship after completing the program in Chile, resuming operations in the U.S. or Europe where obtaining more cash isn’t such a challenge. Through the follow-on fund, Start-Up Chile will offer 60 million Chilean pesos (about $100k USD) in new financing to three graduates per batch of 30 upon completion of the three-month program. Just like the accelerator, the SCALE funding is equity-free. Of course, there’s a catch — the money will be given through a co-financed grant, in which the $100k will account for 70% of the total funding and the recipient of the grant must put up the remaining 30%. “The startups need to figure out a way of finding that capital, that 30%,” says Vidal. “The people in the industry that we’ve talked with are really comfortable with that model.” And the second condition? The company must incorporate in Chile, and plan to stick around for a while. “We never talk about Chile as a final market, because it’s not big enough,” says Vidal. “What we sell is that Chile is a great platform to start, to test, and to grow from. The political sphere is stable, the economy is stable, all of the legal things actually work, the regulations are friendly… so if you can set operations in Chile and grow from Chile, it will be easy for you to grow in the rest of Latin America or abroad.” This is a model that a number of countries have sought to replicate. Start-Up Chile’s directors have worked with the organizers of Start-Up Brasil , Start-Up Perú , and Malaysia’s MaGIC , sharing a playbook they’ve created with any countries that are interested. “Governments move in herds — they try to follow each other, they’re not risk takers,” says Torsten Kolind, CEO of YouNoodle, the startup competition platform that’s been running Start-Up Chile’s application process from day one. Start-Up Chile was the first of its kind back in 2010, but Kolind has seen a recent uptake in government-backed programs joining YouNoodle’s platform, aiming to replicate the success of the Chilean model. “There’s a recent wave of government now that finally seems to get that a startup ecosystem may hold the key to long term national development,” says Kolind. And this is arguably the strongest evidence of Start-Up Chile’s success — it’s still working out the kinks in Chile, but in the meantime it’s catalyzed a Startup Nation movement across the globe.

"Snowden Queries Putin: Are You Spying On Everyone, Too?

 Edward Snowden, who leaked secret U.S. documents that revealed mass surveillance, asked ex-KGB agent and current Russian President Vladimir Putin on live TV today about spying on civilians:  “Does Russia intercept, store, or analyze, in any way, the communications of millions of individuals?”  Putin was at an annual ask-Vladimir TV event with a live audience, and Snowden’s question was shown on TV screens in the studio. Reuters news service said it was not evident if the question was asked live or via a recorded videoclip.  Snowden also asked: “And do you believe that simply increasing the effectiveness of intelligence or law enforcement investigations can justify placing societies, rather than their [individual] subjects, under surveillance?”  The question was in English, and Putin, who speaks some English, requested translation assistance from the moderator. Snowden is currently living in Russia, which accepted his request for asylum after he leaked the National Security Agency (NSA) documents that exposed massive surveillance by that agency. The U.S. government has charged him with espionage and theft of government property.  “You are an ex-agent and spy,” Putin told Snowden, who actually was a contractor for the U.S. National Security Agency, not an agent. “I used to work for an intelligence service,” Putin added, which generated some laughs in the audience.  The Russian leader then said that his government employs bugging to fight crime and terrorism for specific targets but that, “on a massive scale, on an uncontrolled scale we certainly do not allow this, and I hope we will never allow it.”  He added that the Russian government requires court approval for surveillance of an individual and that this is the reason there is no spying “of a mass character here and cannot be in accordance with the law.” He noted that “we do not have the money that they have in the States or the technical means.”  According to the translation provided in a video of the event by Russia Today , a Russian government-funded international news service, the question presented to Putin actually asked if Russia had “ever been involved in intercepting the calls of millions of ordinary citizens.” Russia was, of course, the largest part of the Soviet Union during the Stalin and Khrushchev eras, when public surveillance and the use of secret police were rampant.  Both political celebrities used the exchange to expand their anti-surveillance bona fides: Snowden to show that he wasn’t just picking on the U.S. when he exposed and criticized the NSA’s mass surveillance program, and Putin to show he is Mr. Legal.  At the same TV event, the leader who wouldn’t dream of doing anything illegal refused to rule out sending Russian troops to take over Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Russian troops are currently sitting on the Ukraine border. Armed, pro-Russian militants have taken control of several cities in the east, a coordinated campaign for which Putin has denied involvement.  Earlier this week, Pulitzer Prizes were awarded to The Guardian for its coverage of NSA documents made available by Snowden, and to the Washington Post for its revelations about NSA activities.

"Line’S Coo Officially Takes Over As Ceo To Turn The Messaging App Into A Mobile Services Platform

Three months after announcing the transition , Line has officially received shareholder approval to appoint Takeshi Idezawa, the messaging app’s former chief operating officer, as its chief executive officer. The company said that Idezawa will take over the reins from its previous CEO, Akira Morikawa, today. Morikawa will move on to a position as an advisor. It has been a busy year for Line as it seeks to transform itself from a messaging app into a platform that provides a wide array of services for users to access from their smartphones. According to Line, Idezawa’s accomplishments during his 12 months as COO include Line’s new “LIFE platform strategy,” which wants to turn the app into “an integral part of everyday life in an era where smartphones have evolved into an indispensable device for people all over the world.” The “LIFE platform strategy” has included the creation of a $42 million fund to invest in companies that provide online-to-offline, e-commerce, payment, media, and entertainment services that can potentially be integrated into Line’s core app. One of the main reasons Line is focusing on adding more services to its platform is to make sure that its earnings are no longer so closely tied to its main messaging app (which monetizes through branded accounts and the sale of stickers) or its connected games platform. Revenue from games have plateaued for Line , as well as other messaging apps like WeChat . The company is also key to grow outside of Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, its key markets in Asia. Last year, Line postponed its IPO to focus on its global business, with Idezawa saying that it would localize features for different markets, like voice services in Europe .

"192.Com Published The Ages Of 27M People

192.com is getting into some interesting the areas. The portal that no-one knows what it’s for any more (Tagline: “Search for People, Businesses & Maps” – so that narrows it down, huh) has put up the approximate age (e.g. “25-29”) for 27 million UK residents. In addition they launched the most detailed aerial maps of London yet put online. They say this new feature makes it easier to find old friends because, even though a person’s address may change, their date of birth always stays the same. Hmnnn, comforting. 192’s data is normally taken from uploaded electoral records, but they say the age guides are not based on the actual date of birth of individuals but modeled on data from a broad sample of the population using “complex mathematical algorithms”. Exactly the business model for this move remains unknown.

"Zynga Designers Help Pulitzer Prize Winners Create Social Charity Game

  Zynga announced today that it’s lending out its game developers to help create a social charity game on Facebook.  Production has already begun on a “social action” game based on Half the Sky , a best-selling book by Pulitzer Prize winners Nicholas Kristof (a New York Times columnist) and Sheryl WuDunn about “turning oppression into opportunity for women worldwide.” The Facebook game debuts November 13, thanks to significant staff time donated by Zynga.  “Zynga’s role in bringing this game to life is particularly special to us,” said Half the Sky authors Kristof and WuDunn.  “Using a game to potentially reach great numbers of people helps send a message not only that there are challenges women face around the world but also that they bring great spirit and joy to their communities when they can live safe, normal lives.”  The game is part of a multimillion dollar “transmedia” effort that includes a four-hour PBS miniseries. The game is under development from Frima Studio , and its executive producer is Games For Change , an advocacy group for making games that support social good. Maro Chermayeff, the president of Show of Force, is also serving as an executive producer. Chermayeff is making the PBS miniseries, which airs Oct. 1-2.  “We’re using every tool and platform available to get the message across,” WuDunn said in a video.  The Half the Sky book came out in 2009. It sparked a movement to address “the central moral challenge of our time” – ending the oppression of women and girls worldwide. About 30 nonprofits are currently participating in this project. Other media include mobile games in India and Africa, websites, educational materials, and more. The Facebook game has support from the Ford Foundation, the U.N. Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts.  “The mission of Zynga.org is to help make the world a better place through games,” said Ken Weber, Zynga.org ’s executive director. “Zynga’s employees are eager to leverage social games for good, and we are honored to be collaborating with Games for Change and Frima on this important initiative.”

"Kryptokit Launches Rushwallet: An Instant, Cross-Platform Bitcoin Wallet

In an effort to help widen bitcoin’s reach and create a simpler experience when dealing with the online currency, KryptoKit , makers of the bitcoin wallet browser extension , launched RushWallet , a new easy-to-use bitcoin wallet that works on all web browsers and mobile devices and unlike other wallets, it doesn’t require any login credentials. RushWallet is a mobile-enabled website that lets users send and receive bitcoin payments instantly. You create your wallet by using a “color in” feature when you first enter the site. By dragging the mouse around in a specified area, the user generates a unique secret URL that becomes their RushWallet. There is an option to add a password to add more security. Because there are no login credentials, users have to bookmark their wallet to save it. If you lose your URL, you can never access the wallet again, however much the amount you have stored. Once you have your RushWallet, you are presented with your bitcoin address and the bitcoin price. You can view your balance, receive or send bitcoins (you can toggle between BTC and USD) and view a transaction history. The transfers are instant and make a beep sound when you receive bitcoin. To purchase items with your bitcoin, simply add the bitcoin address for the store you’re purchasing from and add the amount. Anthony Di Iorio , co-founder of RushWallet, says KryptoKit doesn’t store any information or bitcoins as it is all stored on the local machine on the client-side. The company made the source code publicly available so that users can verify the security of the system. This system can prevent hacking, like the crisis that happened to the now defunct Instawallet . The wallet integrates with bitcoin username registry system OneName , which eliminates the need to copy, paste or scan a bitcoin address. Typing in a OneName username in RushWallet will add that user’s bitcoin address. RushWallet is dead simple to use and can help open the bitcoin industry to a wider audience — just don’t forget to save that URL.

"Twitter Skyrockets After Reporting Big Q2 Revenue Of $312M, Profit Of $0.02 Per Share

Update: In after-hours trading, Twitter is now up more than 20 percent following its massive beat. Update II: Twitter is now up just under 30%. Pretty sure Twitter HQ is where the party will be at tonight. This afternoon Twitter reported its second quarter financial performance, including revenue of $312 million, and earnings per share of $0.02. The street had expected Twitter to lose a penny per share on revenue of $283.07 million. Its revenue in the quarter was up 124 percent from the year-ago period. In the second quarter of 2013, Twitter’s revenue totaled $139.3 million . In its most recent, sequential quarter , Twitter had revenue of $250 million. In the period, 81 percent of Twitter’s ad revenue came from mobile advertising. The company reported that it has 271 million monthly active users, up from its 255 million tally in the first quarter of 2014. That’s up 24 percent, year-over-year. Twitter’s monthly mobile user count was also up, to 211 million, a gain of 29 percent. The company had adjusted EBITDA of $54 million for the three-month period. Keeping the non-GAAP statistics coming, Twitter reported that it derived $1.60 per thousand timeline views, up 100 percent year-over-year. Twitter rose more than 1.5 percent in regular trading in a down day. In after-hours trading, following its earnings beat the company is massively up. This was a massive quarter for Twitter. Stronger-than-expected user growth attached to big beats on both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share have delighted investors. The other side of the coin? Twitter’s GAAP net loss totaled $145 million, up from $42 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, Twitter lost $0.24 per share. Investors, however, were not expecting Twitter to be profitable by GAAP measurements, so the loss isn’t too much of a drag. Looking ahead, Twitter expects revenue for the third calendar quarter of 2014 to come in between $330 million and $340 million, strong guidance. The company expects similar adjusted EBITDA, and large stock-based comp expenses. So, expect those GAAP losses to continue for now. TechCrunch will tune into the earnings call at 2, so get ready for more.

"Google Wallet Now Lets You Send Money To Any Phone Number

 Google today updated its Google Wallet app for Android and iOS with support for sending money to phone numbers, although only in the U.S. You can download the new version of the app from Google Play and Apple’s App Store (it’s rolling out “in the next few days,” so don’t fret if you don’t see it yet).  Until now, you needed to give Google Wallet an email address. With this latest app update, however, you can just send money to anyone in your contact list with a phone number.  The best part is whoever you are sending money to doesn’t need the Google Wallet app. When you send money to a phone number, the recipient will get a text message with what Google says is a secure link. Tapping that will let them enter their debit card number to claim the money, which will be available in their bank account “within minutes.”   This is the only feature addition to the app. The changelog states, “We’ve made it even easier to send money. You can now find and send money to anyone using just a phone number.” as well as “Bug fixes and visual improvements.” — but the latter is present on every Google Wallet app update.  The Google Wallet update before this one added improved contact suggestions (so you see the people you send money to most often first), a security feature that lets you lock the Google Wallet app with the tap of a button, and the ability to link a second bank account.   With the launch of Android Pay, Google refocused Google Wallet as a P2P payments app . Branding confusion aside, it’s a smart move, and Google Wallet is slowly but surely becoming something many are giving a shot. The ability to send money to phone numbers might just be enough for the app to gain some momentum; too bad it’s limited to just one country.

"Peter Rojas Leaving Aol Alpha For Betaworks

With Gizmodo, Peter Rojas set a state for talking about technology and gadgets like human beings. That would be a nice feat once, but he did it again with Engadget, Joystiq and gdgt. Now, he’s leaving Verizaol* for an entrepreneur-in-residence position at startup birthing matrix and investment firm betaworks . Rojas came to Aol via the acquisition of gdgt, which betaworks invested in early on. I spoke to both he and betaworks CEO John Borthwick a bit about his motivations for the move, what he’ll be doing and betaworks plans for the west coast. “I’d been planning to move to San Francisco in July, but hadn’t intended to switch jobs at the same time; my original plan had been to continue to lead Alpha from here,” says Rojas. The Alpha group is an experimental arm of Aol that makes internal and external products designed to keep the company innovating. It’s launched a couple of consumer-facing products so far including Pip! and Starlike . Rojas says that his Alpha co-director (and gadget co-founder) Ryan Block will take over sole directorship, along with a leadership team that includes director of design Michael Cosentino, director of technology Evan Fribourg, and product director Drew Lesicko. “They are all insanely talented and will definitely keep things moving forward,” said Rojas. “Having Peter help Ryan Block and I get our Alpha group off the ground has been exceptionally valuable for Aol,” said Aol President of Media Brands Luke Beatty in a statement. “Peter is one of the most strategic savvy people in our industry. He’s a pro. I know Betaworks will grow with Peter representing them in the valley. No doubt.” Verizon, said Rojas, was not his reason for leaving. “Verizon buying Aol wasn’t a factor in my decision to leave. If anything the incentives to stay only increased after the acquisition, especially since Verizon seems pretty committed to keeping Alpha going. “But a few weeks ago I was catching up with John Borthwick to tell him about my move and it led to him asking me if I’d like to join betaworks as an EIR to help out with seed investing and serve as sort of an ambassador to the West Coast. I’d been thinking for a while that about moving into investing, this seemed like a perfect way to test the waters there and get to work with a bunch of people I think are awesome.” The deal seems like a way for betaworks to get a solid toehold on investing in the SF area and the West Coast at large. Rojas says that’s definitely the plan. “I think that awareness is lower than it should be and that is something I plan to work on.” Betaworks currently has around 109 active investments out of 125 total since the firm was started. That includes recent bets like Giphy, Medium and Product Hunt. It also builds and buys companies, including the reborn Digg, Dots, Chartbeat, Instapaper and Socialflow. Though its investment arm is only a portion of what betaworks does, it has still managed a 5.65x return, says Borthwick, making its results solid enough to compare to a similar-sized seed fund. Out of those investments, only about 25 percent are in California, and they’re all in the north, near San Francisco. betaworks has yet to invest in a SoCal company. The majority of those investments have been in the city proper. “I’ve always been a big fan of what John and his crew have been doing there,” Rojas said in an email response to a question about why he felt betaworks was the right place to be. “Betaworks’ model of taking new product ideas and getting them out to market quickly to figure out whether they’re viable or not was a huge inspiration for what we’ve been trying to do with Alpha,” he said. “I’ve also just generally been close to them over the years. I’ve been friends with John since 2003, when he was working at Time Warner and I was editing Gizmodo (there’s a funny story about us getting booed on stage at a Time Warner corporate off-site), and betaworks was an investor in gdgt — both our seed and A rounds.” The story, by the way, was that Rojas showed up on stage at the offsite with a bunch of video-playing devices loaded up with Time Warner content like HBO shows and movies. The only problem? Time Warner didn’t have an official digital content distribution arm at the time, so Rojas’ source was pretty much the same as all of ours was at the time: le torrents. The reception was…not warm. Word is they eventually got over it . This isn’t the first time that betaworks has experimented with the EIR format. Josh Miller of branch was a part-time EIR before he went to Facebook and Andrew McLaughlin joined as an EIR after Tumblr — eventually moving to a partner position and taking on the CEO role at Digg. EIR roles can be pretty loosey goosey when it comes to defined goals. I asked Rojas exactly what it means in this case. “It means I’ll be bringing my mix of entrepreneurial, product, and editorial experience to bear helping betaworks looking for new investments and working with portfolio companies,” he said. “EIR roles are by definition transitional, but that doesn’t mean I am going to be hanging out for a few months while I figure out what comes next. I recognize that in a lot of ways I’m starting from scratch and I’m going to have to work really hard to make the most of the opportunity.” Borthwick says that they’ve been trying to make this happen for two years. When GDGT was acquired, they talked about an EIR position, but the timing wasn’t right. This time, it was. “Having somebody who is based on the west coast to support betaworks, evangelize, act as an ambassador and find new investments makes sense, and I can’t think of anyone better than Peter.” *I’m not sure what the proper name is so that’s what I’m using until a spokesperson corrects me. Oh, and Verizaol owns TechCrunch.

It comes at a time when there seems to be some upheaval in the company around the importance management has been putting on this product. The marquee feature of GitHub Enterprise 2.5 is support for clustering. With this, businesses can now set up a cluster of GitHub Enterprise servers that act as a single installation, enabling it to support significantly larger teams. “With GitHub Enterprise 2.5 more users can be enabled on one system as teams grow,” Kakul Srivastava, GitHub’s VP of Product, tells me. “We have customers with tens of thousands of developers who need to be able to work together, and this is really important functionality to enable them to do this in a scalable way.” She also noted that clustering doesn’t currently come at an additional cost to GitHub’s enterprise users. This new version also includes interface improvements with updated designs for everything from log-in screens to the look and feel of the GitHub repositories. This brings GitHub’s enterprise product in line with its hosted version. Also new in this version is improved Subversion support — for those who aren’t using git as their version control system — as well as an API for managing protected branches (that is, branches developers can neither delete nor force-push their code to). This new API is currently in preview. In a written statement, Srivastava said that she believes GitHub is “building a new kind of enterprise company; for us and our customers, it’s not about open source or enterprise, but rather, open source and enterprise.” She added that GitHub’s “focus on the developer gets to the heart of serving them wherever they code — personal projects, open source communities, and even the very largest enterprises in industries such as banking, retail, and manufacturing.” None of this, of course, addresses the concerns around the company’s changing culture, but there can be little doubt that GitHub’s future is directly tied to enterprise customers adopting its services to manage their code.

"Oprah Wants You To Say Thank You By Playing Her Game

  Oprah Winfrey wants to spread kindness and positive emotion around the globe. The media queen’s latest venture, Oprah’s Thank You Game , encourages Facebook users to thank someone in their lives then report it back her. The game’s page keeps track of all the goodwill spreading around in the form of purple blobs stretching across a world map. You know, sort of like a plague tracker…  The developer, SuperBetter Labs, hopes this project will inspire players to feel gratitude toward each other. “We had a vision for a social game that resulted in every single person in the United States and Canada feeling truly appreciated for something they’ve done, ” Sean Baenen, vice chair of SuperBetter Labs said in an interview with Gamasutra . “It was an ambitious project in the field of social media as agency for positive emotions, making Ms. Winfrey the perfect partner.”  While this project is more of a social tracker than an actual game, it does try to spread a very hopeful message.

"40M Users Later, Viddy Arrives On Android

  Video-sharing application Viddy landed on Android devices today after long being available only on the iPhone.  Los Angeles-based Viddy makes a mobile application for shooting 15-second clips that can be enhanced with video effects called “production packs.” The company touts 40 million registered users and is often referred to as the “Instagram of video.”  The startup, which historically only supported uploads via iPhone, is traversing the mobile chasm with its first native application for Android that is said to support more than 757 different Google-powered smartphones and tablets. The release, several months in the making, comes more than 19 months after Viddy first landed on Apple devices in April 2011.   Viddy for Android follows the same 15-second shoot-spruce-and-share model as its iPhone predecessor, but it comes with 10 fresh video effects. The application also includes 16 soundtracks for adding audio to your clips, supports background processing (unique to Android), and is optimized for HD cameras on Android devices.  In a perfect world, Viddy for Android would help the young startup double up on users, content, and activity, but reality may be more bleak.  Competitors Klip and SocialCam, now an Autodesk property, already have a presence on Android, as do a number of other mini-video apps and services. Viddy co-founder and CEO Brett O’Brien believes, of course, that his app is better than the rest on the extremely popular platform because the company took the time to understand Android’s differences.  “Android has great technology, but developing a superior social mobile video product which exceeds user expectations on this platform is complex. There are different form factors, different versions of the operating system, challenges in accessing hardware acceleration for editing, etc,” he told VentureBeat. “We are the only company to even attempt this, and we think we have created a great experience for people.”   Viddy was all anyone could talk about in the first half of the year, but it’s hard to get an accurate reading on its level of hotness these days. Press attention peaked shortly after the company raised a $30 million round in May, partly because Viddy’s meteoric rise was driven by Facebook’s Open Graph and seemed unsustainable ( it was ).  Third-party tracking service AppData pegs Viddy’s monthly active Facebook-connected users at just 600,000. The startup does continue to see a healthy influx of videos from its celebrity members; the ever-influential Justin Bieber still uses Viddy to reach his 328,000 followers on the service. Meanwhile he has 4.2 million followers on Instagram.  Viddy also has an influential cavalcade of A-listers who want to see the app succeed. Biz Stone, Shakira, Will Smith, and Jay-Z are among the service’s celebrity backers .

"Craigslist Censored: Adult Section Comes Down

Bad news for Craigslist users who like to peruse the Erotic Services Adult Services section of their site. It’s gone, replaced by a large black and white “censored” logo. I’ve reached out to Craigslist for comment and await their reply. But the choice of words is significant – the section wasn’t simply removed, the censored word was used. The site has been embattled as old press and state attorneys general use any excuse to blame sex crimes on the site. From South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster’s failed crusade against them to a variety of press stories about sex and other crimes. If it’s just a sex crime it isn’t a story. But if a listing on Craigslist was involved, it’s a big story . Craigslist has fought back using little more than their blog and logic . And they’re right. Having prostitution up front and regulated, as Craigslist does, means less crime is associated with it. It’s not like prostitution, sometimes called the world’s oldest profession, was invented on the site. The fact that eBay and others do exactly the same thing , but without human review and moderation, doesn’t seem to matter. Craigslist Sex is what scares the general population, and it’s what the press and the politicians will continue to use to get their hits and votes. So the Craigslist Adult Section was removed. Is the world now a safer place? Update: This only appears to affect U.S. sites, so if you’re looking for a happy ending in Saskatoon or the West Bank, have at it.

"Dear Facebook, Please Return Our Social Networking Space

The following is a guest post by David Dalka . Dalka is a digital business strategist and keynote speaker who was a member of BlackRock (BLK) during its hyper-growth phase of 80 to 800 people. He is a top ten contributor to CrunchBase, strategist to senior executives on how digital marketing tactics are transforming business strategy and revenue generation, blogger and is currently working on a nonfiction business book proposal. According to TechCrunch Editor Michael Arrington, Dalka currently lives in a location of “ horrendous weather eight months out of the year”. (Editor’s note: Maybe you can entice him to move somewhere else? Seriously, we really do pity him.) Photo courtesy of 2010 Internet Hungary conference. About a month ago there was a loud outcry when Facebook inexplicably introduced a smaller font size to its News Feed. The lack of communication from Facebook while making a significant change is sadly nothing new. You could tell that the angry and highly upset Facebook users that day knew instinctively that this event was not in their best interest. A month later, hidden behind all the public relations hoopla regarding Mark Zuckerberg’s chat with former President Bush and appearance on 60 Minutes, I finally realized the motive for last month’s text size reduction. It appears that the smaller text size was set up to pre-condition users for the larger coverage area of ads on the screen by making the ad columns wider, thus allowing more ads to be shown above the fold and closer to your newsstream. Do they actually disrespect your personal space that much? Is this how little (pun totally intended) Facebook thinks of you, their userbase? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be yes. This conversation is about much, much more than Facebook.  Linkedin reducing your ability to search your social network, Yelp reportedly using high pressure tactics to sell ads, Twitter’s promoted tweets, etc.  Only you have the power to end this cycle of abuse by social networks and it is time for the web community to stand up and shout that they are sick and tired of constant terms of service changes, privacy changes, steps backward in usability that degrade our mutual experience, comfort level with the sites we use and our enjoyment of the web. Some people like Shel Israel have asked that Mark Zuckerberg step down as CEO of Facebook. That is not the point of this post. The point of this post is to help social media users understand how startups lacking well thought out and viable data, business and revenue models are the root cause of the symptom of constantly oscillating user experiences. It is my hope that you will reject the new profiles. It appears that the changes in screen real estate usage are between the old Facebook profile and the new Facebook profile are significant. TechCrunch techs estimated the pixel usage changes for this purpose. It’s tricky to measure the differences — with the new profile Facebook has actually adjusted the total size of the profile (increased by around 20 pixels), and has tweaked all of the profile elements, including photos and the Wall, and there’s also the issue of how much whitespace to measure. But what is clear is that there has been a significant reduction in your social media experiences with your friends. In the old version, the ads had a photo with text underneath and now the text is alongside the photo. The old edition had an ad width of about 160 pixels while the new edition now clocks in around 245 pixels, a ~53% increase in ad width – yikes! The ads are now around 140 pixels high compared to around 230 pixels previously. While the overall size of the ads has not changed very much, they appear denser and more of them can now be seen above the fold.  Amazingly, the new ad sizes have been mentioned favorably in certain circles . Even more interesting is that the ad text size is the same as before while your wall font is smaller, which means you are more likely to be distracted by the ads.  An offline analogy might be when a television channel turns down the volume of their shows, while keeping the volume of commercials higher. As I stated in a recent podcast interview with Peter Clayton, regardless of whether you are an individual or managing a business, you do not own your terms of service on a social networking site. Think of it this way, a social networking profile is like an apartment, while a web site built on a domain you own is property that belongs to you. You don’t see too many people rent an apartment and then invest $20,000 in remodeling the kitchen do you? This is because the improvement in property is not owned by the individual and the future values of the improvements are highly uncertain. The same is true of social networking sites. This is typically not seen as a problem by individuals. It also goes unnoticed by most traditional brand marketers as they are used to expiring, non-measurable media in the pre-Internet era of marketing and often not held accountable by senior management.  Once fully understood by senior business executives, the microeconomics of marketing channels has emerging implications for enterprise business strategy, marketing budget resource allocation and eventual redefinition of the skill sets required to lead businesses into the future successfully. The first phase of the web focused too much on business ideas without technology execution, the web 2.0 phase was skewed towards technology without a tight correlation with business results.  For our economy to thrive and the USA’s standard of living to be maintained, it is important that the proper balance between business monetization model and technology to ultimately occur sooner rather than later. Here is a brief list of concepts that should be considered to make our society conserve scarce capital and allocate funding resources efficiently: – Users should demand that social networks stop abusing their rights – with constant nontransparent terms of service and user experience changes, social media users are being whipsawed. This is not sustainable. It starts with you demanding better treatment not only from Facebook but also from all social networks. – Venture capital should require viable revenue model path explanations – The Businessweek article, The “ Lost Decade ” for Venture Capital states, It is my belief that is a symptom of certain venture capital professionals not focusing tightly enough on data models and potential revenue models prior to funding rounds. If I’m ever a limited partner at a venture capital fund, one of the questions I’ll be asking is “Please explain three to five potential revenue model paths that could work with your concept?” I don’t expect them to be right and I don’t actually expect them to be the one that works out. What I would expect is for the entrepreneur to have a focus on executing with low cash burn rates and have a passion for solving the monetization problem. Stated another way, if they aren’t focused on building a sustainable revenue model as a core passion before the venture capitalist writes a check, when will they ever be? Think about more companies like TC40 company mint.com. Companies should have their data and potential monetization paths organized prior to funding events occurring. To be clear, these do not need to be implemented on day one; however the infrastructure of the startup should be properly designed to enable this data and revenue generation vision from day one. Yes, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, Sergei and Larry likely never envisioned Adwords when they started Google, but that was a one in a billion exception.  My point is that it is the exception, not the norm. Valuations not based on actual cash flows and/or audited revenue numbers need to be viewed with a much higher level of scrutiny. “Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Ebay will buy it ” is likely NOT a valid business model any longer – eBay bought stumbleupon.com for $75 Million then spun it off for $29 million two years later. eBay also disposed of a large chunk of Skype after not meeting the acquisition objectives for it. TechCrunch has written in detail about this previously. Kudos to eBay CEO John Donahue for recognizing the issues and having his management team take swift action to put closure on the issues. It would appear that the days of eBay buying things without revenue models is now behind it. The ongoing drama involving MyBlogLog and Delicious could also be attributed to lack of a viable monetization model before acquisition or Yahoo’s inability to change the data model to create one after acquisition.  Delicious, once the data was normalized and reconfigured, had realistic potential to be an awesome blog content relevancy engine. Unless something major changes, it would appear that Yahoo! will not be buying any non-revenue generating start ups anytime soon. Google walked away from buying Digg as reported by TechCrunch. Could it be that Google’s acquisition team saw a Stumbleupon or Delicious type scenario on the horizon? We’ll never know for sure, but it’s an interesting question to revisit at this juncture. To prevent future situations like this, the startup community should encourage the design and funding of companies with long term sustainable data and revenue models that respect the user experiences, companies capable of standing on their own two legs and having viable initial public offering (IPO) potential that could withstand the test of a financial audit. – For the same reasons, Google should resist overreacting to social media – To be clear, this problem affects many established companies investing in new projects. Nick O’Neil wrote a post in August entitled, The Center of the Google vs. Facebook War: The Like Button, he stated, Sometimes social media hype prevents analysis of the actual facts. Google appears on track to exceed $8 Billion dollars in net income, an increase over 2009’s $6.52 Billion in net income audited by Ernst & Young. One of Google’s risks is new innovation from within that disrupts its primary cash cow and as such, Google will likely survive just fine regardless of anything Facebook does and Google doesn’t match with a reaction. In fact, it likely has a higher chance of survival. To be clear, investments in startups without a focus on monetization from the start are having cross over effects in the mainstream business community. Executive leadership teams in companies both large and small need to align their business strategy and marketing budgets to the new realities of content and communication in our society to prevent future business failure . Corporate marketing budget allocation and executive team skill selection are way behind these emerging realities. This needs to change. When a start up focuses on viable revenue models and provide a valuable, long term service from inception everyone wins – users, businesses, investors and the overall economy. It is vital to a focus on funding concepts with potential long-term revenue models capable of creating sustainable value to customers and long term cash flows that can withstand a financial audit, provide a valuation based on valid fundamentals of finance and capable of becoming companies capable of initial public stock offerings. The alternative path is a never ending cycle of takeover, heartbreak and destruction .

"This App Turns Your $600 Apple Watch Into A $20 Casio Calculator Watch

Plenty of people have compared the Apple Watch to the classic Casio calculator watch; these guys went ahead and made the inevitable app. Meet GeekWatch — the app that turns your Apple Watch into an old-school calculator watch. I mean, sure — you could buy a calculator watch on Amazon for like 15 bucks . But where’s the meta/hipster/ironic/kinda-obnoxious humor in that? They swap out the “Casio” brand for “Geekio” for obvious (read: legal) reasons, but the inspiration is clear. One catch: since Apple hasn’t enabled custom watch faces yet, it’s not able to take over the entire screen, and you’ll still have some borders/margins/text around the edges. Alas, it costs a $1 . On the upside, there are myriad goodies to unlock if you poke it in the right way. Remember trying to spell words upside down to pass the time in class as a kid? That’s a good place to start. Alternatively, check out the tizi Calc app ; the Casio-style homage isn’t as direct (and also costs a buck as an in-app purchase, though the app itself is free), but it’s got that same geek-stalgia vibe going for it.

"Major 3Ds Update Goes Live — Adds 3D Video Recording And Other Nifty Features

 While the XBox dashboard update is grabbing all the headlines, Nintendo has quietly updated the firmware for its 3DS console, meaning that users will now be able to capture up to ten minutes of 3D video and make stop-motion animations.  This major update has also introduced ‘accomplishments’ to the device, the closest that Nintendo has yet come to offering Xbox-like achievements.  The update, which is now available directly through your 3DS console, adds new puzzles to the StreetPass Mii Plaza, along with a new dungeon for the StreetPass Quest game. These games are part of the unique Street Pass functionality of the 3DS, that allows users to share Miis and profile information as they pass each other on the street.  The ‘accomplishments’, added in this update, all relate directly to the Mii Plaza, and include ‘meet Mii characters from ten countries’ and ‘receive a personal greeting’. Given Nintendo’s previously reported scepticism about the value of achievements in games, it may be that these accomplishments will not spread beyond the Mii Plaza. But Nintendo is is renowned for springing surprises on its customer base, so nothing is for certain.  Another key feature of this update is the ability to transfer content, including software from the Nintendo eShop, account funds and save data, to a new 3DS console. Nintendo details this process on its support site, and users will no doubt be pleased to see this more flexible approach being taken, especially given the content locking that was seen on the DSi . There are some restrictions to the 3DS  transfer process – up to five transfers are permitted in total and there will be a waiting period applied between each transfer. In addition, content can’t be exchanged between systems with different region or country settings.  If you have a 3DS, then it should automatically request an update to this new firmware. If it doesn’t, then you can follow the procedure to perform a system update, as outlined on Nintendo’s support site .

"Tron-Club Sends Circuits To Your Home In Jolly Packages

 While Tron-Club sounds more like a weekly meeting of Tron enthusiasts who enjoy dressing up in unitards and making whooshing sounds as they pretend to ride invisible Lightcycles, it’s actually a service that sends circuits to your home. Why? Because you should learn electronics, that’s why. As hardware becomes easier to build and understand, programmers are finding themselves at a loss. While we can all write a little Python in a pinch, putting together a circuit is another matter altogether. Using the Tron-Club packages you can learn how to build stuff like a pulsed Piezo buzzer , the utility of which is limited but still interesting and could be usable in other projects down the line. I am not bullish on educational circuit toys for kids. I think these things, which are essentially updated versions of the classic electronics kits aren’t interesting enough to hold attention. However, I think kids and adults can both learn from Arduino and Raspberry Pi kits while adults especially are helped by handling kits like Tron-Club’s. The service costs €14 a month or €150 (plus shipping.) You can cancel at any time. In the end electronics is all about making loud noises and magical smoke so it’s great to see Tron-Club provide us little fun while they learn electronics. Just don’t zap your eye out.

"There'S A Man Trekking Around Tokyo Taking Pictures Of Film Cameras

In a city as big and vibrant as Tokyo, you can expect to find anything, but I have to say that old-school film cameras would be pretty low on my list. The future-freak nature of the city would lead me to suspect that you wouldn’t even find a regular digital camera, since everyone has autofocus 8MP cameras and xenon flashes on their keitai . But on the other hand, it’s a city and culture that thrives on pockets of deep obsession, so you’re just as likely to find a camera aficionado as a… I don’t know, a model train aficionado. Photographer John Sypal has been collecting shots of other camera wonks’ gear on the streets of Tokyo for a while now, and has documented it all on a spartan little Tumblr blog . It’s a fun little blog and it reminds me of my prejudice in photography: having been exposed to primarily American and some European photographers, I always thought of this kind of camera-love as a sort of western thing. But clearly I’m mistaken; next time I’m in Tokyo I’ll have to keep my eyes open for Leicas and such.

"11 Ways To Fail Every Time With A Pr Agency

 While many are predicting the death of the agency of record (AOR) model in advertising, it remains alive, though not necessarily thriving, in our parallel universe of PR. There’s no standard benchmark on the average length of the PR agency/client relationship, but my unscientific research on Google pegs it at less than three years. That’s a very generous estimate, and it’s trending down.  When PR agency/client relationships fail, as they increasingly do, the agency typically takes the fall for poor performance. Oftentimes this is valid, and oftentimes it’s because the partnership was mismanaged.  In a climate where agencies more frequently are the party taking the heat for bad results, accountability for building a successful partnership goes both ways. After more than 20 years of counseling technology companies at various stages, here’s my advice to CEOs and their marketing teams on how to avoid pitfalls when managing an agency relationship (with some great perspective from several other industry pros).  1. Don’t block access to senior leadership. While internal marketing and communications professionals need to be deliberate about how and when to involve senior executives, an agency/client relationship will frequently fail when the agency doesn’t get consistent access to leadership. Beyond the opportunity to collaborate, build trust, and absorb evolving company narratives from top brass, these executives are also tasked with creating alignment around their company’s vision and purpose. By blocking access, you’re also blocking the inspirational x-factor senior leaders bring when telling the company story. Less access begets less inspiration and media currency.  2. Don’t covet the most important influencer relationships. It’s not uncommon for internal PR teams to manage relationships with a shortlist of their company’s most important influencers. In fact, this is good business. At the same time, when clients treat these relationships too preciously and gate-keep to the point where agencies have no access, a failed partnership is often on the horizon. Smart agencies bring unique, informed, and unbiased perspective based on their own relationships with these influencers and add helpful context that comes from having worked with them to tell myriad stories on different topics, people, and companies. Over-gatekeeping also signals a lack of trust, which is toxic to the client/agency relationship.  3. Don’t remove the agency from your true north. This one is obvious but so often overlooked. The first weeks of the partnership should be laser focused on activating your PR agency around your company’s business, marketing, and positioning goals. Great agencies will have a focused method for information sharing and discovery that arms and illuminates them with what they need to be successful. Be leery of an agency that favors a more ad hoc approach over a clear system to kickoff the partnership and measure success ongoing.  4. View the agency as a strategic partner, not an operations partner. According to my business partner, Tyler Perry , “Keeping your agency in a vacuum and having high expectations that they are going to nail your story is a recipe for disappointment.” Great agencies are great strategists and executors. If you want to own the content, story lines, and strategy, you’re better off building out an internal team that can deliver at both levels. If you hire an agency that relishes tactics without a critical eye for impactful story lines, you’ll almost always fail. At a minimum, you’ll get what you pay for.  5. Don’t put your business and marketing communications goals in silos. According to Barbara Bates , founder and CEO of Eastwick, “Too often, the CEO’s priorities are actually different from the communications or marketing lead’s goals. If an agency is supposed to keep both happy, they need to make sure they get agreement on what the goals are and what success looks like.”  6. Share your real business objectives (acquisition, IPO etc.). As an extension of the above, Joanna Kulesa , principal at Kulesa Faul, says, “It’s important for the agency to know what the company’s end game is because it may influence elements of the communications strategy. Holding business objectives too close also may signal a lack of trust in the agency partner.” Communications can impact major business outcomes; don’t be afraid to bring them in.  7. Don’t make measurement political. According to Bates, “Instead of objectively viewing measurement as a way to benchmark and measure impact, we have seen clients afraid to disclose measurement results or worse, purposely manipulate results to make their programs (and therefore themselves) look better. Measurement should be less political. Clients should be open to seeing what’s working and what’s not, and the real pros will review the results regularly and, with their agency partners, make adjustments. Do more of what works and less of what doesn’t. Great agency/client relationships talk about these things openly.”  8. Don’t bring on PR just to check a box (i.e. at the board’s request). A successful partnership and reciprocal value is also a function of why you’re hiring an agency. According to Kulesa, “If a company doesn’t truly believe in the value of PR and enthusiastically support and participate in the program, it will never get much value out of a PR program. No one wins in this scenario — the company’s brand awareness fails to grow, the agency can’t be successful, the board ends up unhappy.”  9. Don’t go rogue with the media. Many journalists prefer to have conversations with expert sources without a communications gatekeeper “controlling” the discussion or even listening in silently. While one-on-one communication with journalists leads to authentic relationships, your agency should never be left in the dark about those communications. According to Kyle Arteaga , cofounder of The Bulleit Group, “Talking to the press without informing your agency limits them from delivering the most value because they lack relevant information. Even that informal conversation you had with a journalist over drinks last Friday might impact both your coverage and our media strategy.”  10. Don’t hire a PR vendor. When a company needs legal representation to go public, it hires the very best attorney with an eye on maximizing every ounce of value and minimizing risk. According to Kathleen Shanahan , founder of BOCA Communications, “When a company hires a communications agency, it should not be for purely tactical execution, it should be for savvy, smart and sound communication counsel. When you hire a vendor, you get vendor-grade results.”  11. Talk about money. My business partner Fred Bateman says, “Money matters — period. And it’s critical in creating a fair, equitable, and mutually satisfying relationship between an agency and a client. The client needs to feel they’re being provided a fair service for a fair price and that they’re getting their money’s worth. The agency needs to believe its earning a fair value for the work being performed. This equity, however, is often not there – and both sides are equally to blame for avoiding difficult conversations about cost. Agencies can avoid this fail by always keeping the fiscal relationship front and center and having more frequent discussions about budget as opposed to less.”  Bill Bourdon is a co-owner and partner at Bateman Group , a digital communications agency for technology brands.

"Dropbox’S Lepton Lossless Image Compression Really Uses A ‘Middle-Out’ Algorithm

The “middle-out” algorithm that has its roots in the most infamous (and probably funniest) scene in HBO’s “Silicon Valley” may have been fictional, but something like it can be found in Lepton, a cool new lossless image compressor created by Dropbox. Lepton reduces the file size of JPEG-encoded images (and that’s most of them) by as much as 22 percent, yet without losing a single bit of the original. How is this possible? Middle-out. Well, it’s much more complicated than that, actually. Lepton gets one part of its savings by more efficiently encoding brightness values that are stored in a highly deterministic way in JPEGs. The details, which might be a bit hard to follow for the average bear (or, if I’m honest, blogger), can be found at this blog post . The middle-out bit comes toward the end of the decompression bit. The algorithm looks at the border between two of the 8×8-pixel blocks JPEG creates, where on one side the decoding is already done. The un-decoded side tends to follow a brightness gradient established by that found in the pixels leading up to that middle area, so the algorithm makes a prediction based on that. It then saves only the delta between this prediction and the real value — formatted to be a good fit for the VP8 arithmetic coder. The brightness coefficients encoded this way tend to make up about 8 percent on average of images the team encountered, but they shrunk that 8 percent by about 61 percent, giving from this method alone a 5 percent reduction in overall file size. The other 17 percent (remember, the total is 22) savings comes from various other techniques that, if you can believe it, have an even less entertaining story behind them. You won’t notice any of this; Lepton compression is only done on Dropbox servers, where your data is put into cold storage. When you request it, Lepton’s work is reversed (and fast) and you get the vanilla JPEG. But on Dropbox’s end, it saves petabytes of space. Lepton is open source, and Dropbox has put the code for it on GitHub . Feel free to tinker with it — and if you made it this far in this article, you’re probably likely to!

"Activists Challenge Sf’S Google Bus Program On Environmental Grounds

San Francisco city supervisors and affordable housing activists butted heads again over a new pilot program to manage tech commuter shuttles from Silicon Valley-based companies like Google and Facebook. A handful of activist groups say that the new pilot program, which charges tech companies $1 per stop, must undergo environmental review. That would involve a lengthy legal process that could take months or years. Update: The Board of Supervisors voted 8-2 against having the pilot program go under environmental review. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency had previously exempted the pilot program, which was passed back in January, from environmental review. The program is set to charge $1 per stop fee, in part because the city’s transportation agency wasn’t legally allowed to create a revenue-generating program. So the pilot program can only pay for its costs, which are expected to be $1.7 million. Richard Drury, a lawyer for the coalition of activist groups including SEIU 1021, the Housing Rights Committee, the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club and The League of Pissed-Off Voters, said, “These are pirate shuttles.” “This is the opposite of school busing,” he added during testimony before the Board of Supervisors at City Hall. “We’re busing wealthy, predominantly white adults into low-income neighborhoods, where they in turns displace low-income people. This is the reverse of affirmative action.” Scott Wiener, a supervisor who represents parts of the Mission and the Castro neighborhoods, challenged Drury. He said that the issue wasn’t even about environmental impacts. The implication is that the suit is abusing California environmental law to halt or slow the process of gentrification happening in neighborhoods like the Mission. “This has to do with a political current, that involves a pretty significant set of assumptions that technology workers aren’t real San Franciscans,” Wiener said. “But as anybody who knows, quite a few of them have lived here for a very long time. Many of them used to drive and now take the shuttles.” A study from the city’s budget and legislative analyst’s office yesterday found that there were just over 8,000 boardings per day on shuttles from companies including Google, Apple, Facebook, Genentech and Yahoo. That suggests that there are about four thousand tech workers using these shuttles every day. A separate study from a pair of UC Berkeley graduate students found that 40 percent of the shuttle riders would move closer to their job if the buses didn’t exist. “Let’s just assume that for the sake of the argument that that entire percentage leaves SF. That’s about 1,000 of these workers leaving San Francisco and moving to the peninsula. Put that in the context of a population increase of 75,000 people [over the last 10 years],” Wiener said. Drury pointed to some other findings from that city study, that showed that the buses weigh around 60,000 pounds and cost the city more than $1 per mile in damage to road pavement. “We should minimize the impacts on the city, and maximize the benefits by charging the shuttles more than $1 to load 100 people when I  have to pay $2 per ride for MUNI,” Drury said.

"Confirmed: Intel Acquired Digital Signage Company Cognovision

Intel has just bought Toronto-based digital signage company CognoVision. According to a report on the Daily Dooh, the acquisition price is around $17 million. We’ve also heard a credible rumor that the deal was worth north of $25 million. We reached co-founder and director of business development Haroon Mirza on the phone who refused to comment on the report. UPDATE: Intel has confirmed that it has acquired CognoVision. Terms of the deal, which closed in September, are not being disclosed. A spokeswoman for Intel told TechCrunch that the acquisition is part of Intel’s ongoing development of its digital signage strategy. CognoVision’s digital signage offerings go beyond just providing compelling displays for marketing purposes. CognoVision’s computer vision technology provides customers with analytics and intelligence around customer interaction with displays, including data on the number of people who look at displays; how long people look for; the number of people who walk by; how long people stay near displays; and anonymous semographics of the display’s audience (gender and age bracket). Intel and CognoVision actually have an existing relationship. Cognovision has partnered with Intel to show how processors are used in  Digital Signage applications. If Intel did pay $17 million for CognoVision, that price is a drop in the bucket for the company. Intel recently acquired smartphone chipmaker Infineon for $1.4 billion and McAfee for nearly $8 billion.

"Samsung Offers 100% Of Revenue To Indie Developers That Use Its App Store

  Indie developers can sell their games on a variety of different mobile app markets. Apple’s iOS is a popular choice. Google’s Play store is big on Android, and so is Amazon’s Appstore. Now, Samsung is trying to establish its Samsung Apps platform for Android as a legitimate competitor to those more robust alternatives.  Samsung announced a campaign to encourage indie developers to release their games on Samsung Apps called “100% Indie.” This initiative promises that indie developers that release their games on the market will receive 100 percent of the revenue between March 4, 2013 until Sept. 3, 2013. After that, Samsung guarantees the studios will receive a higher share of the revenue until March 2015. At that point, the split will revert to 70 percent for developers and 30 percent for Samsung.  Samsung is partnering with Chillingo , Electronic Art’s smartphone-gaming label, to help manage this promotion.  Developers can head to 100percentindie.com to get started. Chillingo will fast-track the first 3,000 studios to sign up.  “Samsung continues to diversify the applications we offer on Samsung Apps, and 100% Indie is the latest example of that commitment,” Samsung project manager Juyeon Lee said in a statement. “Through 100% Indie, Chillingo is the right partner to help us tap into the creativity of the indie community and ensure we are bringing the best games to Samsung devices around the world.”  Chillingo plans to use its mobile-gaming experience to help Samsung decide which submitted games will make it on the service.  “With over 10 [years] in the mobile gaming space, we uniquely understand what drives and motivates the game makers of today,” Chillingo co-founder Chris Byatte said.  “Making a game is hard. Developers are looking for inspiration and opportunities. ‘100% Indie’ is designed to help independent developers take full advantage of these amazing revenue opportunities and bring their games to Samsung Apps,” said Joe Wee, another co-founder of Chillingo.  The standard revenue split between developers and platform holders is currently 70/30. Promising a bigger piece of the pie to small indie studios seems like a smart way to get games on Samsung Apps.  Samsung’s Galaxy S III is one of the best-selling Android phones. In March, the company plans to introduce the Galaxy S IV .

"Stay Warm While Contracting Incurable Cancer This Winter

Most of my female friends — yes, I have some — are smokers. Why is it? Because they’re full of angst and hate life, and they know smoking makes you exactly 26% cooler than not smoking, they’re not dumb. Anyway, Seattle this winter has been cold , far more so than last year. Thank goodness the girls at Shiny Shiny have shown me these smoking mittens that I, in turn, can show my smoking girl friends. Sure, they could be unisex, but guys don’t wear mittens. OK, not real guys. OK, not me, anyway. Also, I don’t smoke. So there. $30 from Cocktail Equipment, and oh-so worth it.

"What Canada Winning The Olympic Hockey Gold Medal Looked Like On Facebook

If you’re either American or Canadian (or just a hockey lover), chances are you were watching the gold medal hockey game yesterday. And with over 400 million users, there’s also a good chance you have a Facebook account. So what does it look like when those two worlds collide? Like the picture above. As you can see, Facebook status updates per minute exploded at two times yesterday. The first peak, at 2:29 PM PST, is when Zack Parise of the U.S. tied the game with a goal in the third period. The second, much larger peak took place at 2:54 PM PST, when Sidney Crosby scored the game-winning goal for Canada in sudden-death overtime. All told, more than 3.5 million status updates were sent during those two times, according to Facebook. Perhaps even more remarkably, that was twice the pace of updates for the rest of the day. While Twitter has yet to release similar stats, the service also undoubtedly saw an explosion of tweets during those two times. At one point after the U.S. scored, my entire tweet stream except for two tweets was some variation of “USA USA,” “OMFG!! USA,” “GOAL HOLY JESUS USA !!!1!!!,” or the like. Data released a week or so ago had Twitter seeing 50 million tweets per day now. Meanwhile, recent Facebook data says that the networks sees over 60 million status updates posted each day (from 35 million active status updaters).

"Cloudflare Raises $110M From Baidu, Google Capital, Microsoft, And Qualcomm

 CloudFlare , a company offering a content-delivery network (CDN) with security features to make sure websites stay online and load quickly around the world, is announcing today a $110 million funding round with major strategic investors: Google Capital, Microsoft, Baidu, and Qualcomm.  The news comes a few days after CloudFlare announced a partnership with Baidu , provider of the biggest search engine in China, as well as a deeper partnership with cloud provider Google Cloud Platform.  Now CloudFlare is working with Qualcomm to optimize connections between CloudFlare’s network and phones with Qualcomm chips, and it’s also looking into servers packing ARM-based chips from Qualcomm, as CloudFlare cofounder and chief executive Matthew Prince told VentureBeat in an interview. CloudFlare is also figuring out ways to deepen its partnership with Microsoft, Prince said.  CloudFlare, which offers premium Denial of Service (DoS) mitigation and web application firewalls to stop certain kinds of cyber attacks, has developed into a major player on the Internet. The company says it has 4 million customers, including Cisco, NASDAQ, Reddit, and the World Economic Forum. WikiLeaks has used CloudFlare, too. (Prince actually ended up meeting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.)  Direct competitors include Imperva’s Incapsula , but in the CDN market, specifically, it faces competition from top cloud provider Amazon Web Services, as well as Akamai, Fastly , Instart Logic, MaxCDN, and Verizon’s EdgeCast. But CDN on its own isn’t especially interesting, Prince said.  “We think the real opportunity is to take the functionality performed in a Cisco, F5, Juniper, Riverbed, or any other firewall you have out there, and provide that,” he said.  The company expects to hit a $100 million revenue run rate by the end of the year, and an initial public offering is possible as soon as 2017, Prince said.  Fidelity Management and Research Co. led the new round in San Francisco-based CloudFlare, which started in 2009 and launched in 2010 . The round closed in December 2014, Prince said, adding that, since then, CloudFlare has opened a new data center every week.  To date, CloudFlare has raised $182 million, including the $50 million round announced in December 2013.  CloudFlare is open to partnering with additional vendors, including competitors like Amazon and Alibaba.  “We’re happy to work with anyone in the ecosystem,” Prince said.  A CloudFlare blog post has more on the news.

"The Deanbeat: Fallout, Skyrim Director Todd Howard Earns Lifetime Achievement Award

 Todd Howard isn’t a big guy, but he’s going to be honored as one of the giants of the video game industry. Howard, creator of blockbuster games such as Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, will be given the prestigious lifetime achievement award at the annual Game Developers Choice Awards in March. This is a big deal because Howard’s peers have chosen to give the award to somebody who has been one of the most commercially successful game developers.  Howard is the rare combination of an artist who grasps the craft of making video games and is able to use that talent to make mainstream titles that sell in the tens of millions of units and generate billions of dollars for his company, Bethesda Game Studios. The studio is a division of Bethesda Softworks, which is itself a division of ZeniMax Media. The award is considered one of the most prestigious in gaming because it honors the recipient’s entire body of work, and it is awarded by game development peers.  Howard, the game director at Bethesda and steward of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls action role-playing game series, will receive the award at the Game Developers Conference event in San Francisco, with the ceremony falling on March 16. The award recognizes his innovative contributions to open world game play and game development.  Above: I wonder how much someone is going to charge for horse armor. Image Credit: Bethesda Softworks  That’s because games such as Fallout 4 and Skyrim aren’t just linear experiences, which you can finish by following a single narrative. Instead, they are full-fledged virtual worlds, as alive as the fictional world of Middle-earth, created by J.R.R. Tolkien, author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.  Now that may sound like marketing fluff. But in the case of Fallout 4 and Skyrim, it happens to be true because the worlds are massive. The world of Skyrim, a fantasy role-playing game series, even has its own “dragon language.” You could adopt your own children, build a home, and swim underwater. Fallout 4, a role-playing action-adventure set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, has more than 400 hours of game play in it. There are 50 guns in the game with more than 700 modifications. These are open worlds, where the player is in charge of the story and what happens next.  “The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series present gamers with fully realized worlds filled with vast landscapes, and mystery at every corner. We’re proud to honor the visionary developer for his leadership in creating these universes,” said Meggan Scavio, general manager of all GDC events, in a statement. “When you’re completely captivated by these detailed worlds, it’s easy to forget the level of dedicated work and creativity that went into every square inch. This award reflects on the amazing craft of Todd Howard and his team in making worlds as real as anything on Earth.”  Above: Todd Howard talking about Skyrim at the Dice Summit in 2012. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi  Skyrim took something like 100 people about 5 years to make.  Howard gave a talk about making Skyrim at the Dice Summit, the elite industry game conference in Las Vegas, in 2012. He said that developers have to approach game design with discipline. Games, he said, weren’t works of art that hang in a museum. They’re fun entertainment that has to run at a speed of 30 frames per second or more on an affordable consumer device that packs the processing power of a supercomputer.  “Find things that a player does a lot,” like looking at a list of tasks to do. “Make that fun and entertaining. Take a repetitive action and make it simple and fun,” he said.  When I heard him talk at the previous Dice, he ended his talk by noting that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that games are legally works of art. And that means game designers have to show what they can do with that freedom.  Skyrim shipped in 2011, and it took five years for Howard’s team to create Fallout 4. If you figure 100 people were on the Fallout 4 team, that kind of game might cost $100 million to $200 million to make and market. (That’s my guess).  Howard is also an interesting character because has been at the same studio for 22 years. The company has certainly changed around him, as owner ZeniMax Media has amassed a number of game studios, including id Software, the maker of the Doom series.  ZeniMax has been acquiring the rights to various game properties (including the original Fallout) from a variety of companies, and it has been building teams to make high-end PC and console games based on those well-known properties. Over time, ZeniMax has raised more than $450 million in private equity funding to finance its deals, such as the purchase of id Software.  It is this structure within a larger company that allows Howard to do what he does and to take all of the time he needs to get a game right. In many companies, there’s an unhappy tension between the money people and the creators. The money people want to rush the game out, and the creator wants to make it perfect. I don’t know if Howard has this kind of tension or not. When I interviewed him on the red carpet a couple of years ago, I teased him about why he didn’t have a game ready to announced.  He said, “Come on, Dean. You have to be on my side.”  It was a little comment, but it was something that I remembered. Even a guy like this, who has this kind of track record, seems to have his own battles to fight.  Looking from the outside, there doesn’t appear to be a ton of pressure on Howard to get his stuff done sooner. Bethesda didn’t even announce Fallout 4, the big game from 2015, until the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June of that year. And when it did so at the Dolby Theater, where the Oscars are held, Howard walked out on stage and got a huge roar of applause. His company leaders stood back in the shadows and let the game maker do the talking and get the accolades.  Above: Todd Howard introduces Fallout 4 in the Dolby Theater in 2015. Image Credit: Bethesda  “You all came. This is amazing. Holy crap. When I first started at Bethesda, 21 years ago, there was no E3,” Howard said as he walked out on that famous stage. “There was CES in Vegas. Video games were in the ancillary tent, with the porn. I am not kidding. Look at all of us here. Look at video games.”  He added, “Games can do things that nothing else in entertainment can. They can transport you to new worlds. They can give the true wonder of discovery and often the pride of accomplishing something yourself in a game. It’s a wonderful moment.”  Now the game industry has a lot of people who promise a lot and under-deliver. Howard is one of those people who doesn’t promise anything and then delivers something that is truly astounding. Howard was an early pioneer of 3D worlds, creating an early 3D shooter on the PC in 1995 with The Terminator: Future Shock. He was also the lead on titles like The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and Fallout 3. Skyrim sold more than 10 million units, and Fallout 4 has shipped more than 12 million copies. He also directed Fallout Shelter, a mobile title that hit the top of the app stores last summer.  Howard is going to talk again at the Dice Summit in a couple of weeks. So we’re going to see more of Todd Howard publicly in the next few weeks than we’ve seen in the past five years. It’s a kind of victory lap for him. But it will be fun.  He’s one of the people that the game industry can honor and say, “Look how far we’ve come.”  Above: Fallout 4 Image Credit: Bethesda

"  Pepperhealth Can Detect Vitals And Send Out An Emergency Alert For Elders In Trouble

Pepper, the humanoid robot, is coming up with all sorts of ways to serve its human overlords, including in eldercare. The little rolling robot took to the stage at the Disrupt SF Hackathon today to show how it could help our aging parents, should they fall and not be able to get up . According to PepperHealth creators Ethan Fan and Angelo Hizon – both Battlefield NY 2015 veterans for fitness app VimoFit – PepperHealth will also detect a rapidly rising heart rate, check in on how you’re feeling, follow up on your sleeping habits and remind you to take your meds — the robot will even call up an Uber for those unable to use a smartphone. It works by detecting abnormal vitals through the Watch such as a rapid heart rate or a fall and then Pepper “wakes up” and comes over to check out what’s going on. Should something serious happen, Pepper will alert a built-in emergency system and give medics the elder’s location to get them immediate assistance. There are a few glitches to the system, however. Old people will need to purchase an Apple Watch and a Pepper robot (only available in Japan at the moment), pricing it out to a bump over $2,200 U.S. That’s still cheaper than hiring an in-home care assistant to monitor someone around the clock. And the robot could be used in an elder care facility, assisting hundreds of people at the same time. Of course, the Apple Watch could also detect a fall or a heart problem using its own monitoring system — reducing the cost by nearly 200,000 yen, but it doesn’t have that humanoid interaction that Pepper offers, say the creators. The idea has the potential to help the more than 41 million senior citizens in the U.S., tapping into the $320 billion elder care industry.

"Rhapsody'S President On Price Cut, Mobile Future

Rhapsody is going solo and cutting prices along the way. The digital music service is spinning off from its parent companies, MTV/Viacom and RealNetworks.  The newly independent company is called Rhapsody International .  In honor of its new status, the company is also releasing an Android app and dropping its premier monthly subscription fee by a third to $9.99 a month, from $14.99. “We are free to move forward and chart our own market course,” says Rhapsody’s President Jon Irwin. Under the spin-off, which was initially announced in early February, RealNetworks and MTV/Viacom will each maintain a 47.5 percent stake in Rhapsody , according to an SEC filing this Tuesday. The restructuring will leave Rhapsody with a nice nest egg: Real Networks provided $18 million in cash, in addition to content licenses and other assets in exchange for stock while MTV/Viacom promised $33 million in free advertising for its share. In addition, there are two minority stockholders which own the remainder of the company, including Vivendi’s Universal Music and a private investor (who owns a relatively small portion). Rhapsody International also announced the official launch of its Android app today. The app, which is free to download and free to try for seven days (afterward you pay $9.99 a month for a subscription), gives users full access to Rhapsody’s entire catalogue. The hefty price cut to $9.99 is just another acknowledgment that the music subscription market is getting fiercely competitive. Rhapsody, under the RealNetworks/MTV umbrella, has struggled to grow its subscriber base and stay ahead of the mobile app curve. In fact, Rhapsody has been slowly bleeding customers, the company had roughly 750,000 subscribers at the end of June 2009. In less than a year, that number is down to roughly 675,000. Meanwhile, competitors are nibbling at their turf: Spotify is preparing for its US launch, Apple just acquired Lala.com, and MOG recently launched its All Access music service. The company is still deciding how it will communicate its subscriber numbers going forward. However, he says Rhapsody’s growing increasingly optimistic on the iPhone and the new Android apps— so far its iPhone app has enjoyed more than 1.5 million downloads. In addition, the company is releasing a Blackberry app by the second half of this year and hopes to become profitable for the fourth quarter as well (the business currently generates about $130 million in annual revenues). While he acknowledges that his top competitors like Spotify and Thumbplay are generating serious buzz, he says Rhapsody is best positioned to eventually dominate the mobile space: they’re “really starting from scratch, we’re on the path to profitability, we have the proper funding in place and significant marketing in place, with a history of partnerships like Verizon, Sonos…that we can expand upon.” He adds: “If Apple enters the market, it’s a validation of the model we have.” Rhapsody’s future will clearly be determined by how fast it can innovate in relation to its competitors and whether its users are willing to accept their $9.99 subscription model. On the innovation front, users should expect more social media and discovery tools on mobile apps that will help fans track artists and tap into a variety of social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. Irwin says you’ll be able to signal to your networks (via your iPhone, Android and Blackberry) what you’re listening to and your playlists. “We have our destiny in our own hands, now being an independent company we’re ready to take on the competition, it’s going to be a great year,” Irwin says. We’ll see what their competitors have to say.

"Thnks Fr Th Mmrs: The Rise Of Microblogging, The Death Of Posterity

A poor life this if, full of care, We have no time to stand and star e – W.H. Davies, Leisure A little over a week ago, I closed down all of my social media accounts, with the exception of Twitter, which I locked . The explanation I gave was that, in an age when everyone and their dog is sharing every aspect of their life, being a digital recluse is the new “Internet famous”. Since then, some people have criticized my logic – pointing out that if I really wanted to be a digital recluse then I’d close Twitter too (update: I have now ). By drawing attention to myself for becoming a semi-hermit, am I not just trying to have my social media cake and eat it too? Perhaps. The truth is that there were numerous reasons for me wanting to dial down my use of social media, but presenting numerous arguments in one column is the kiss of death to a columnist. The neo-narcissistic benefits of locking Twitter were  what finally made my decision, and so that was the reason I gave. The others would keep. This morning, though, Leo Laporte wrote a hugely revealing blog post and, in doing so, artfully proved the misquoted maxim that the medium is the message. In short: Laporte discovered last night that, due to a glitch in Google Buzz, several weeks of his updates had failed to reach either Buzz or Twitter. The kicker? Not one of his tens of thousands of followers had noticed, or cared. Leo’s response was a vow to turn his attentions back to his blog – a place where people visit specifically to read about Leo, and where they email in the hundreds if he skips an update. By contrast, he argues, people on Twitter are so busy broadcasting their own updates that they’re unable or unwilling to listen to others’. But, while I certainly agree with Leo’s reasoning for abandoning Buzz and going back to macro-blogging, it was another – almost throw-away – line in his post that chimed most loudly with me. Reading that line, I instantly felt Leo’s pain. When I was researching my most recent book – which mainly focusses on the events of the past three years of my life – I spent several days going back through my blog archives , plus Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and the rest – to remind myself of details and events that may have been missing from my more traditional notes. What I found – or rather didn’t find – shocked me. Throughout my earlier archives, I was able to find lengthy, sometimes surprisingly personal, posts – recounting the highs and lows of starting companies, making and losing friends, leaving London, beginning to travel around America and Europe… and countless other published episodes that backed up, and enhanced the contents of my private notebooks. But then, as I clicked forward through the archives to more recent years, something odd happened. At a certain point, the number of posts in each monthly archive dropped off a cliff, particularly where details of my personal life were concerned. The reason, of course, was that I’d started to use Twitter for that kind of personal stuff. Unperturbed, I moved my research attentions away from my blog archives and over to my Twitter archives – and that’s when I started to panic: for all the dozens of updates I wrote each month, there was absolutely no substance to any of them. “I  am learning a lot about pens.” reads one update from last year. What does that even mean? “Ok, that’s quite enough of all this. I’m going  out”, reads another . Enough of all what? And where was I going? Of course, the fact that I’m a particularly boring tweeter doesn’t help, but look at anyone’s Twitter account and it’s the same story – 140 characters simply doesn’t give enough depth or breadth to commit events, memories or feelings to the permanent record. I’m one of the lucky ones: I hand-write a lot – and I mean a lot – of notes. Recalling personal experiences is what pays my rent so I have dozens of Moleskine books full of memories to look back on. I also have a similar number of published columns and a couple of memoirs to refer to if my recollection gets patchy. Others aren’t so fortunate. A decade or so ago, a new generation who would previously have kept diaries instead started to set up blogs. Sure those blogs may have been twee or self-absorbed or clumsily written or emo or just plain boring – isn’t that the joy of a diary? – but they at least required the writer to take the time to process the events of their life, and the attendant emotions they generated – before putting finger to keyboard. The result, in many cases, was a detailed archive of events and memories that they can look back on now and say “that was how I was then”. And then along came micro-blogging – and, with a finite amount of time and effort available, the blog generation turned into the Twitter (or Facebook) generation. A million blogs withered and died as their authors stopped taking the time to process their thoughts and switched instead to simply copying and pasting them into the world, 140 meaningless characters at a time. The result: a whole lot of sound and mundanity, signifying nothing. To argue for a mass switch back from Tweeting to Livejournaling (or Bloggering, or Movable Typing…) in the interests of the permanent record is as ridiculous as campaigning for everyone to abandon instant messaging and return to letter-writing . The fact is people are busy (or lazy, depending on your view of humanity) and for the vast majority, immediacy will always trump posterity. But for those of us who have had reason to look back at the past few years –  like me writing my  book,  or Leo having “woken up to a bad social media dream in terms of the content I’ve put in others’ hands” – the realisation is slightly terrifying: by constantly micro-broadcasting everything, we’ve ended up macro-remembering almost nothing.

"Demo: Appwhirl Lets Anybody Create Their Own Iphone App

 AppWhirl is one of 65 companies chosen by VentureBeat to launch at the DEMO Spring 2010 event taking place this week. These companies do pay a fee to present, but our coverage of them remains objective.  Everybody should have their own app. That’s the basic idea behind AppWhirl , which allows anyone to create an app for the iPhone to broadcast a stream of news and other information in real time.  Mountain View, Calif.-based AppWhirl is announcing a new app-creation tool at the DEMO Spring 2010 conference. The tool lets just about anyone build personalized iPhone apps for communicating to your fans, followers, or friends and family. Right now, programmers will charge thousands of dollars to create apps for people. That’s affordable for a large publisher, but not for an individual who might want to distribute a personal podcast along with all of the Twitter or blog chatter related to it. AppWhirl hopes to make developing an app virtually free for ordinary folks.  Richard Jordan, co-founder of AppWhirl, says the strategy resembles that of companies that made it cheaper and cheaper to create websites. At first, in the mid-1990s, web consultants charged thousands of dollars to create websites for companies. Then tools emerged that made it much easier to create sites; no one needed to know HTML code anymore. Eventually, the tools became free, the priesthood of HTML slingers broke up, and the masses were able to create their own websites using tools that made the task easy.  Jordan hopes to do the same with customized iPhone apps that tie together a personal Twitter feed, RSS feed, podcast feed, Facebook status update, YouTube channel, Flickr feed, or just about any other social feed. You drag and drop feeds into a template and check out the resulting app in a simulator. Then AppWhirl creates the code for the app and submits it to Apple’s App Store. For free apps, there is no charge. For paid apps, AppWhirl will take a cut of the proceeds.  Jordan, who  started the firm with Anurag Misra, a software developer who previously worked on mobile projects for Yahoo, said he got the idea over the Fourth of July weekend last year as he heard his Twitter-obsessed wife talk about how there should be personal apps for people. Jordan figured that plenty of people would subscribe to these personal apps and use them frequently; a mother-in-law, for instance, could subscribe to her daughter-in-law’s feed to watch the progress of grandkids.  “We are going after the mass market,” Jordan said.  One of the company’s first users are the producers of the 10th Wonder Heroes Podcast , about the TV show Heroes . The podcasters got lots of followers for their feed, which costs $3 as an app. Jordan said, “If you package something that is ordinarily free in a beautiful way, people don’t mind paying for it.”  Another customer is Starkville, a social network built around the fans of the TV show Smallville . So far, a hundred apps have been built since October, but AppWhirl has made no public announcements about the platform until today.  Over time, Jordan said AppWhirl will add platforms beyond the iPhone, such as Google’s Android. The company has three employees and is considering raising capital. Rivals include Mobile Roadie and Appmakr. Those rivals are charging more for their app creation services. Another rival, Wizzard Media , also says it does what AppWhirl does.  http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f8/980795693

"Mxp4’S Bopler Games Targets Social Music Gaming On Facebook

 About half of Facebook’s top fan pages are related to music. And games are huge on the social network. So it was only a matter of time before someone attacked the opportunity for social music games on Facebook.  That’s what Paris-based MXP4 is doing with the beta launch today of Bopler Games, a new music hub on Facebook with multiple apps. The app allows users to create an original social music gaming experience by picking the songs that play in their favorite arcade-like games on Facebook. Music games are a treacherous market these days , but this genre is one of the few that big rivals such as Zynga haven’t nailed yet. If it succeeds, then MXP4 may establish a new genre of gaming on Facebook.  MXP4 hopes to succeed by providing artists with a way to make money by more closely engaging with fans. It hopes to improve the viral distribution of music and encourage song sales. The means to do that is via a free-to-play game experience, where users can start playing for free but can pay real money for a better experience.  Bopler Games lets players combine a game of their choice and a favorite song from a large catalog of licensed music. The company has negotiated agreements with four of eight major music publishers and labels. Players can challenge friends in matches and send music gaming gifts to their friends on Facebook.  The hub is launching with four music games. The company previously launched its Pump It! music game in March and now has more than 1.3 million monthly active users, making it the No. 1 music game on Facebook. Pump It! was created for the labels under a business-to-business strategy. But MXP4 is going direct to consumers with its Bopler Games hub.  The app is now embedded on artist fan pages with more than 65 million followers on Facebook. Bopler is also launching Space it!, Match it! and Snake it! Each of those apps is accessible via the Bopler hub.  Bopler Games is launching with music from artists including KT Tunstall, Lilly Allen, Digital Underground, Norah Jones, Afrika Bambaataa, Culture Club, Big Country, Jonas Brothers and Fall Out Boy. That catalog is expected to expand rapidly.  The core music game uses a patent-pending technology dubbed Automated Level Design. Albin Serviant, a former Vivendi Mobile executive and chief executive of MXP4, said in an interview that the technology automatically analyzes a song and extracts data based on its rhythm, melody and song structure. It then enables the song to be played within any Bopler game and makes it easy for others to build games around the songs. Six additional games are currently in production for Bopler Games. By June, Serviant expects Bopler Games to have 12 games available.  Fans can play 60-second clips of songs within Bopler up to three times per day for free. To play a full track and enhance the game experience, fans can purchase a “music pass” as well as game boosters using “music cash,” an in-game currency that can be purchased with Facebook Credits (the social network’s virtual currency, which can be purchased with real money). Fans can also earn “music coins,” which are redeemable for passes. The fans earn the coins by playing and sharing games. Each time users purchase a music pass, artists, writers and labels receive royalties.  “We’re uniting two of the most popular categories on Facebook – games and music,” said Serviant (pictured).  The strategy might work because music pages have been some of the most-visited and “liked” by Facebook users. But they have not shown nearly the same monetization potential as games on the site. Bopler Games could help change that, Serviant said.  The company says that the artists using Pump It! on their sites have seen a 30 percent sharing rate and 12 minutes of time spent per session of game play.  The company has raised more than $13 million to date. Backers include Orkos Capital, Sofinnova Partners and Ventech. MXP4 was founded in 2007 and has 15 employees. Rivals include Disney’s Tapulous on mobile phones.

"How Will Apple Respond To The Dmca Revision? They Won'T.

Today’s adjustment of the DMCA has far-reaching legal implications, which will only be evident after a few weeks, months, or even years as various parties exploit them however they can. I’m going to let the experts play in that sandbox. But one of the new rules seems to have had a specific target in mind: Apple. To wit: The language is a bit confusing, but the end result is the legalization of jailbreaking your phone and side-loading apps. Not that it was ever illegal, although some Apple store employees thought otherwise . Now that it’s been made official, however, one might reasonably expect a bit of give from Apple on this point, since they have taken such great measures to prevent such actions. But I’m pretty sure that apart from a little lip service, Apple will continue with the exact same policies, with the sort of blithe arrogance that simultaneously compels and repels consumers. From a legal standpoint, it seems pretty clear that this ruling and Apple’s prohibition of jailbreaking are actually non-overlapping. As I noted in my User’s Manifesto , the only real consequence of your jailbreaking your phone is annulling the license agreement you “signed” when you bought the iPhone — a private contract between a user and a company. The extent of the repercussions is that you’re cut off from Apple; this can be serious, as in the recent case of a guy who actually had a faulty iPad (it caught fire), but Apple refused to return it , as it had been jailbroken. Them’s the ropes, kid. What response will Apple make, if any at all, to this new rule aimed directly at them? They’ll spin it well without saying anything at all, probably in a way like the following: That would neatly cover it in the Apple way: avoid talking about what they’re doing wrong by talking about what they’re doing right. They’re under no obligation to change anything — in fact, they might spin it in a way that suggests that now the app world is a lawful wilderness, and the App Store a secure and well-tended garden in that wilderness (alternately, it’s like lawful evil vs. chaotic neutral). And they’d be right. Of course, some of us prefer the wilderness. There is a different legal implication, though, more distant from the end user. Apple has argued in the past that jailbreaking should actually be illegal, because it involves modification of Apple’s code, and also because it encourages piracy. These objections have been essentially thrown out the window: the first falls because the actual amount of modification done in jailbreaking is extremely small (therefore falling under fair use), the second (already on shaky ground) falls because jailbreaking is a perfectly legitimate way to promote interoperability, among other things. Ars Technica has a little more on this . Obviously there were other arguments as well (and from other parties, such as the MPAA and RIAA), but these new rules take a few arrows out of their quiver. I expect that sort of thing to continue as these rules are tested in specific cases and ideas like “enabling interoperability” and “lawfully obtained” are filled out with precedents. But in the meantime, I don’t think much will change. On a higher level, as well, the DMCA revisions have not addressed the flaw in that large companies issue hundreds of takedown requests at once and the burden of proof seems to be on the accused in many cases. That club could still be wielded against various jailbreaking “freedom fighters,” though I suspect that won’t happen, as the bad PR resulting from these actions often outweighs whatever was gained by filing. Yes, sometimes when something doesn’t relate to Apple, that’s news in itself. Seriously, though, when a major change in a major law specifically targets a popular and occasionally controversial tech company, we weigh in. Update : Apple’s official statement.

"Movieclips Raises $7M To Curate And Mashup Scenes From Movies

Online movie clips site Movieclips.com has raised $6 million out of a $7 million round, according to a recent SEC filing . The startup has previously raised  $3 million. We’ve confirmed the new funding with the company. UPDATE: MovieClips has submitted a new SEC filing indicating the company has raised a total of $6.9 million in the round. Movieclips.com, which launched in 2009, offers a clip engine with over 14,000 different clips from 1,400 titles from the libraries of 20th Century Fox, MGM, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures. Last year, the startup also launched a new product , called Movieclips Mashups, at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York, which allows anyone to make montages of two minutes clips. Along with the studio partnerships (which is half the battle for licensing movie content), the company has also developed proprietary technology that assigns up to 1,000 points of data to every scene, making it super easy to find scenes by actor, film title, dialogue snippet, mood, director, genre, etc. The site also  launched a specialized video player and features an API developers can use to integrate Movieclips on other sites; AOL’s Moviefone actually uses the technology on its platform.

"Evri Comes To Ipad With New Topic-Based News Reader

Realtime semantic startup Evri is debuting its brand-new iPad application today, where it joins the crowded “iPad news magazine” space filled with the likes of Flipboard , The Daily , Zite , Pulse , NewsMix , AOL Editions , News360 and others. To differentiate itself from the pack, Evri’s app employs a combination of social news and topical streams, allowing readers to follow their interests as opposed to just following sources. The new app relies heavily on Evri’s semantic underpinnings to turn unstructured data into topic-based channels. The company’s content discovery engine analyzes feeds from 15,000 news sources, runs the data through its natural language processing (NLP) parser and extracts entities which are put into Evri’s semantic index. In addition, the engine also determines what news is trending based on things like how many times a topic was covered, the velocity of coverage, how often its being shared on Twitter or Facebook and more. And unlike apps like News Corp.’s The Daily, Evri’s index is updated every 15 minutes, not…well, you know, daily . In other words, it’s a fairly robust backend technology that Evri has in place, no doubut helped in part by last year’s acquisition of another semantic search startup, Radar Networks . But more importantly, at least to consumers, is the new app’s interface. Given that Evri hasn’t always been a leader in terms of design, it was a concern. (Does anyone remember Evri’s bright pink “Top Gossip” mobile app? I do . Shudder .) As it turns out, the Evri iPad app is a big improvement in the looks department. The user interface takes a little inspiration from Pulse , as it also features image thumbnails overlaid by white-on-black text. However, Evri offers its own unique take on topic navigation. At the top of the screen are brightly colored squares for the major categories, including Top News, U.S. & World, Entertainment, Sports, Business and Technology. These are preceded by three grey buttons for social news (Twitter and Facebook) and “Now Following,” the section dedicated your personalized list of favorite topics. Tap on any of these major categories to see the trending news within those areas or delve into subcategories using the navigation on the side (also image thumbnails, but smaller.) That may sound like a lot of navigational options, but it’s well done, not overpowering and it disappears when you need it to. As you dig into the various sections, however, you’ll find only articles snippets, not the stripped down, clean text that apps like Flipboard provide. Evri is determined to be more “publisher friendly,” sending its users over to the actual website using an in-app browser, complete with sharing buttons and a “read later” option that supports both Instapaper and Read It Later. For readers, unfortunately, that’s not as pleasant an experience as the iPad-optimized Flipboard, which is, frankly, still the app to beat in this space. In testing, Evri’s app had the occasional slowdown and crashed a couple of times, but the version I used was still in development. Hopefully by today’s launch, those bugs have been squashed. When the app was functioning, it was easy to swipe through pages, star favorite topics, share, save and read articles. Evri for iPad is a free download via iTunes. In the future, it may include in-app advertising for monetization purposes, but the company doesn’t have those details sorted yet. Says CEO Will Hunsinger, Evri first just needed to get in the game. And as they say, joked Hunsinger, “you can’t get in the game if you’re not on the field.”

"Actual Conversations On Twitter Not Possible Until Twitter Lets Us

One of the big complaints about Twitter is that conversations are hard to follow. Users can write a response to a Twitter message (or anything else), but the easy way to do this is to add an @[username] tag to the Twitter, which refers back to the original Twitter user. But by then that original user has often moved on to other subjects, and it becomes impossible to follow the conversation. This morning a new service launched called Tweetree that tries to solve this problem by threading conversations. It works, sort of, but there are occasional errors as the service tries to match up which messages refer to what, and it rarely tracks deeper than one comment. Hardly a conversation. This was all tried before with a service called Quotably , which actually worked much better than Tweetree. Quotably is now sadly in the Deadpool . Quotably was a good way to track conversations on Twitter, but it too had its problems keeping up. The fact is that Twitter purposefully doesn’t want users to be able to track conversations. The content begins and ends with a discreet Twitter message, up to 140 characters long. Competitor Friendfeed does a nice job of tracking conversations by letting users reply to actual messages, not just users. Twitter, for whatever reason (possibly to keep things simple), just doesn’t want that. And until they do, nothing is going to change. Tweetree has other features, like embedding videos and pictures that people link to into the stream. But without proper conversation tracking it won’t gather more than a handful of users, and will soon be forgotten.

"Look At How Bendy This Prototype Samsung Amoled Is

Some flexible AMOLED news for you. (I know, right?) Samsung just showed off a prototype 6.5-inch display that’s less of a hassle to produce in large quantities. (Temperature doesn’t need to be as closely monitored, manufacturing costs have dropped, etc.) Samsung envisages something like this being used in electronic book readers, electronic passports, etc. Paper be damned, I guess. Other news: the response time for the prototype is said to be somewhere around 1,000 times faster than the average LCD. Sounds like it’d be good for gaming, then. Look how bendy it is! (That’s actually pretty impressive. Let’s start a company, get VC funding, and develop games with narrative where the gameplay mechanics are based on bending the screen.)

"Final Fantasy Vii Remake Uses Unreal Engine 4 Instead Of An In-House Tool

 Midgar is getting an unreal makeover.  Epic Games announced today that Square Enix is making the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake with Unreal Engine 4. This is a bit of surprise, as Square Enix often uses in-house engines for Final Fantasy, its premier franchise. The PlayStation 3’s Final Fantasy XIII used Crystal Tools, and the upcoming Final Fantasy XV employs Luminous Studios.  In-house engines like Crystal Tools and Luminous Studios are often expensive and difficult to make, while using licensed ones like Unreal Engine 4 can free developers of much of the grunt work that comes along with a homemade system. Unreal is the engine for in-development releases like Gears of War 4 and Street Fighter V. Other upcoming Square Enix games with Unreal Engine 4 include Dragon Quest XI and Kingdom Hearts III.  “We’re humbled that Square Enix has chosen Unreal Engine 4 to re-create one of the world’s most beloved video games of all time,” said Taka Kawasaki, territory manager for Epic Games Japan, in a press release sent to GamesBeat. “It is a joy to work with the talented developers behind the franchise, and this marks an unforgettable moment in Unreal Engine history.”  It’s surprising that Square Enix isn’t using Luminous Studios especially, since it’s such a new engine for the upcoming installment in the Final Fantasy series. However, development on Final Fantasy XV has been troubled, and even its first demo suffered from performance issues like framerate drops. Maybe these problems pushed Square Enix to use Unreal Engine 4 for Final Fantasy VII Remake, which the developer claims will be bigger than the original game .

"Marketing, Reviews, And Mobile May All Determine If Your Game Is A Hit Or A Flop

  SAN FRANCISCO — After looking at a bunch of data points, the gaming community needs to realize three things: Ladies and old people love games; reviews really do dictate your sales; and your game is good — but marketing will make it even better.  Video game research firm EEDAR revealed its latest findings today at the Game Developers Conference and the results may delight and disappoint you.  Let’s start with the delight.  The ladies, and your grandparents, love gaming, too  It seems a little obvious. Of course women are interested in gaming, but the numbers increasingly support this. According to EEDAR’s research, adult women now represent 30 percent of the gaming population. That’s more than the 17-and-younger boys segment.  The amount of female and, in fact, elderly players has significantly increased with the introduction of the smartphone. Indeed, since the smartphone was released, we have nearly reached an equilibrium between 18 and younger players, 19-49 players, and 50-plus players.  Mobile games have done more than bring new types of players into the pastime. They’ve also changed the reason we play games. Overwhelmingly, 60 percent of people who play mobile games do it simply to pass the time. It has moved from an individual activity that you did in your living room and has expanded into the broader world.  “We basically have a gaming device in every single pocket,” said Geoffrey Zatkin, a researcher at EEDAR. “It’s now social acceptable to play games anywhere.”  Got a bad review? Sorry, that really does suck and might affect your bottom line  Unfortunately, that 1-100 review score your game gets really does have an affect on your sales. EEDAR’s study found that games in the 90-100 review-score range sold many more copies than those who scored in any other levels of reviews. Looking at games only released through from each platform’s launch through December 2012 for the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and the Wii, EEDAR found that only 72 games made it into the 90-100 range. Those games grossed an average of 1,123,000 units sold in their first three months on sale. That’s compared to 454 games that scored an 80-89 review that grossed an average of 449,000 units sold in their first three months.  That’s 382 more games that sold an average of 674,000 fewer units in the same time frame.  EEDAR did a study of three groups of gamers playing PopCap’s casual game, Plants vs. Zombies. They paid everyone $10 apiece and asked each group to read a set of reviews before playing the game — one group read good reviews, one read bad reviews, and the other read a mix (the control group). The results were as expected. Those that read the good reviews all ranked Plants vs. Zombies higher in their own reviews versus the control group and versus the “bad reviews” group.  It got interesting, however, when EEDAR asked each group if they’d rather take the game instead of the payment. Those in the positive group took the game in far greater numbers than those in the negative group, showing that reviews really do affect whether someone is willing to “spend” on a game.  But despite the need to make a really great game, your marketing budget and the timing of your game’s release really could really make the different between a hit and a flop.  Marketing, marketing, marketing = money, money, money  So, you’re about to release a game. You’d better start considering the buzz you want to generate. You have a few ways of doing this: Getting covered in a magazine (see all that review data up there) or a website and buying advertising.  If your game got a bad review, marketing should be your next biggest push.  “Marketing is basically steroids for your games,” said Zatkin.  But marketing is dominated by the big guys — at least in terms of advertising. Over the past few years, Call of Duty has dominated “pop advertising,” or those advertisements you see when you walk into a game store. In 2012, Assassin’s Creed III and Madden NFL 13 also topped the charts in pop advertising positions. But that’s because these games all have huge publishers and big marketing budgets.  How does the little guy get in there? By getting editorial mentions. This can also be a challenge, however. From 2010 to 2012, shooter games dominated the cover-spots on major gaming magazines. Indeed, 53 percent of games featured on magazines were shooters in this time period.  Regardless, marketing is crucial.  He explained in the chart to the right that if you both get great reviews and spend a lot on market, your games are going to sell that much better. If you have low reviews and don’t spend all that much, you’re going to do poorly in sales. But that’s obvious. What about if you compare getting poor reviews and spend lots of marketing money, or the inverse, you spend little money on marketing and get great reviews? Turns out, marketing always wins. If you spend the marketing cash, you are statistically more likely to sell better on the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.  Photos via Meghan Kelly/VentureBeat

"Diy ""Bristlebot"" Hijacked Without Credit By Toymaker

Some time ago, a fun little project was put up on MAKE: attach a vibrating motor to the head of a toothbrush, power it, and watch it zoom around. Fun, right? So much fun, in fact, that toy and book makers Klutz (with Scholastic) decided to make their own and market it under the same name , with no credit to its creator. Really, guys? As much as I’d like to give Scholastic and Klutz the benefit of the doubt in this case, it looks pretty cut and dry. If they simply had recreated the machine, that would be a jack move anyway, but at least you could pin it on a rogue toy designer who decided to pass it off as its own. But the fact that they use the same name means that they did the research and concluded that they just didn’t want to give Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories credit. The internet is alight with indignation, but there has been no response as yet from either Scholastic or Klutz.

"Silver Mario

  In case you've been under a rock, today is the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers original Japanese release.  As I write this, ""Mario Bros"" is the #5 trending topic on Twitter.  In addition to the usual suspects , a ton of mainstream press covered it.  I even saw a headline about the anniversary on that screen in the elevator in my office building.  Y'know, the one that everyone awkwardly stares at, so they don't need to make conversation.  It's appropriate that the anniversary happens to fall on the release date for the latest Halo game, Reach . These two properties couldn't be further apart.   Halo is the very essence of what drives the industry today – a multiplayer-focused shooter fueled by competition, favored by angsty teens (and ghastly teens-at-heart), where it's not uncommon to count more epithets than bodies. I'll admit it – I've never played much Halo .  It just never appealed to me. Mario games look downright quaint by comparison, with bright colors, squeaky clean character design, and all those side adventures in cart racers, puzzlers, brawlers, RPGs, etc.  Just take a look at their flagship characters. Halo's Master Chief is a faceless cipher under that impenetrable helmet. He and his space marine buddies have now starred in six games, but are still mostly marketed around (and purchased for) the multiplayer experience.  Besides, he just wouldn't fit in a fun, happy-go-lucky cart racer.  Mario doesn't speak either, outside of the occasional ""it's-a-meeee!' or ""let's-a-go!""  But his charisma and charm has moved 240 million games just among the character-focused core series.  [embed:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02qFsibe23w ]  Mario has been a constant through some remarkable personal benchmarks.  For those of you just joining us, some highlights: one of my first published reviews was on Mario 64 .  I broke the news to readers (and in turn, some of my friends) about my wife's pregnancy via a post about New Super Mario Bros. Wii .  And when it came time to take the baby announcement photos, my daughter had on a Princess Peach onesie.  Mario was even mentioned twice in speeches at my wedding — one of those during the actual ceremony.  Playing a Mario game evokes much of the same feeling for me as watching my daughter play on the floor does now.  There is an innocence, and a simplicity to it that will always be endearing.  I can't help but smile when it's just me, and the jumping, and the coins.  Happy birthday, buddy.

"Second Life Creators Look To Revamp Reality Once Again, This Time In Vr

Nobody understands community and online social dynamics quite like Linden Lab , the SF-based team that has maintained a very odd, somewhat dysfunctional digital society called Second Life for what’s coming up on thirteen years. The team is now embarking on its most ambitious project yet, a wide-reaching virtual reality network called Project Sansar that is, in many ways, aiming to become a new layer of reality that gives individuals and businesses a space to experiment with VR environments for their first time. I had the chance to sit down for a demo of Sansar with Linden Lab CEO Ebbe Altberg this past week and take an early look into some of the platform’s first environments. Traversing the worlds of Sansar and chatting with my guide, Linden Lab VP of Product Bjorn Laurin, was a mostly seamless experience but still an oddly unsettling one. It’s not that anything was particularly creepy about the place I was viewing through an Oculus Rift headset. Sansar is visually placid and often beautiful, but it’s also startlingly scalable and boundless. Scale is something that’s often taken for granted in an age of video game epics like Skyrim and GTAV, but when every horizon you see through your own point-of-view is conquerable, you’re left to either feel very bold or very lost . Linden Lab is hoping creators feel empowered by the platform to build worlds that solve problems and create opportunities for social interaction. The company is currently taking applications for 3D content builders to take part in a Project Sansar Creator Preview . Project Sansar is designed to allow every average Joe to create their own VR-facing presence or space on the platform as easily and non-technically as they desire. Linden Lab is hoping to monetize their VR world by building what is essentially an app store for VR creative properties. That could mean a small business buying a trade show template someone else designed so that they can host a digital get-together in Sansar, or it could mean a university purchasing a classroom or lab model to build their own VR presence and teach students in more immersive ways. It’s almost trivial to think of more specific examples because in many ways Sansar is trying to crack the base question of what physical presence means to communication and whether additional benefits can be yielded from a VR environment when it’s replicated to a T while implementing actions and mechanics that aren’t possible on earth. At a certain point, when their guards are down, companies in the VR space seem to subtly allude to the fact that they’re expecting virtual reality to swell up to replace a pretty significant percentage of our active lives rather than just enhance it. There were plenty of concerns at the beginning of this millennium that video games like Second Life were ushering in a godless digital era that would soon see people strapping computers to their faces and foregoing real reality entirely. Sansar is not quite OASIS, the all-encompassing fictional VR world detailed in the novel Ready Player One, but it is looking to evolve in a similar pattern. Sansar perhaps has more challenges ahead of it than any VR platform I’ve interacted with, but that’s largely because it’s just so frighteningly ambitious. Like Second Life, Project Sansar is not an experience that needs to be perfect at its initial launch or see a certain number of first week user numbers to be a hit. It just has to stay consistent, evolve with the hardware/interface trends of modern VR and steadily push boundaries as it updates. Linden Lab is a uniquely bizarre company that is still thriving off the successes of a product that was introduced when people were grabbing AOL disks to connect to the web. In the decade since the greater public stopped caring about Second Life, nearly a million people have continued logging in and checking on their digital lives, running digital businesses, making digital friends and digitally living out their odd sexual fetishes. During this past 13 years, Facebook and the social media revolution have taken off and taken hold, powerful smartphones found their way into a few billion people’s pockets and the way we all interact online has grown richer and more engrossing. Yet all those people keep logging in to take stock of their virtual lives because regardless of how much the theoretical polygon counts on the latest systems increase, the hardest thing to replicate online will always be a sense of community. This area will be where Sansar faces its greatest test, building a digital community for a new generation of internet users on a medium that’s not yet fully understood. The early beta shows great promise and while a wide release of its desktop and VR versions is still likely months away, it’s clear that Linden Lab understands the daunting magnitude of both Project Sansar’s challenges and its potential.

"Doesn’T That New Metroid Title Feel Like Ninja Gaiden?

 I saw the E3 trailer, and like most everyone on the internets, it was a surprise and delight to see a dev team like Team Ninja to collaborate with Nintendo on a new, different Metroid title.  My Nintendo fanboy impulse tells me to immediately get it day 1.  But then, why do I have this odd feeling like I’ve seen this before, or that no one else seems to notice it?  A lot of work was being put into this.  A cohesive story plus Samus’s direct interaction with people is something completely different from Metroid titles I remember.  But looking at the gameplay part of the footage, the impression that I’m seeing a Ninja Gaiden game with the locales and characters switched out stands out more to me each time I watch the video.  There’s your special attack moves, combos, crazy over the top action, acrobatics – its all there.  Definitely not a bad thing, mind you.  The current Ninja Gaiden series (with all its iterations)  is fantastic.  It just confuses me no one (if any) drew a parallel between them.  Has anyone else felt the same watching the trailer?

"New Relic Grows 130 Percent, Poised To Hit $100M Runrate (Exclusive)

 New Relic , the fast-growing software analytics company that tracks how applications are performing, said it had growth of 130 percent in the most recent quarter compared to same quarter a year ago.  The San Francisco company is private, so it doesn’t release revenue or other financial data. But the company says it’s set to generate more than $100 million in annual revenue run-rate by March 31, the end of it of the 2013 fiscal year.  In an interview with VentureBeat, Patrick Moran, the company’s chief marketing officer, said the New Relic originally made the projection in July of 2012 , but that if anything, “we’re accelerating a bit.”  The company’s fast growth comes at a time when app performance-tracking has become more important than ever for businesses.  New Relic provides companies with visibility into their apps, not just at the code level but also by pulling in data about everything that an app is syncing with — across multiple languages (Ruby, Java, Node, PHP, etc), service apps, and hybrid cloud infrastructures.  Businesses are increasingly integrating apps with each other so that apps make frequent API calls upon each other, including for data and other updates. Companies are also exploiting the benefits of cost-effective cloud infrastructure, which means they’re starting to run apps in many different places — sometimes on the public cloud, such as Amazon, or in private clouds, such as Openstack, or even upon a mix of these clouds. All of this requires more sophisticated tracking and performance monitoring.   Editor’s note: Our upcoming CloudBeat conference , Sept. 9-Sept. 10 in San Francisco, will be tackling revolutionary cases of enterprise cloud usage, including how companies like New Relic are helping with things like cloud integration. Register today!    New Relic competes against AppDynamics, another company seeing tremendous growth . Until now, the two businesses have focused on somewhat different markets. AppDynamics is targeting midsized to large companies that often run their apps on-premise and behind a firewall. New Relic has so far focused on its software-as-a-service model (SaaS), offering its product over the cloud — finding more resonance among smaller or midsized companies.  Smaller customers have until now meant smaller revenue for New Relic. However, New Relic is clearly moving up-market. It has increased customer accounts by more than 10,000, bringing the total 50,000, it said. Among those were BBC Worldwide, Disney-ABC Television, Ericsson, Ford, and Sony.  Indeed, in an interview, Moran attributed the new growth to an increasing readiness of enterprise to embrace SaaS. “It’s accelerating at a more rapid clip,” he said. “Bigger customers are driving bigger revenue.”  Part of this trend toward bigger clients lies in New Relic’s efforts to make it dead-simple to get started. It has spent four years refining the starting experience. Licensing fees are low for customers at the earlier, more experimental phases of an implementation. But as those customers expand to other projects, such as mobile, they will implement New Relic on those as well. “We’re certainly in the business of land and expand,” Moran said.  Mobile, in particular, has driven New Relic’s growth. For example, New Relic won the business of a major cable company for a tiny $5,000 project to monitor that provider’s mobile app that competes against Netflix. From there, though, the customer expanded the business to become a $500,000 account within a year. And this year, it’s now over $1 million, as the company uses New Relic across its other apps. “It all started when they bought us online without even talking to a sales rep,” Moran said.  Online brokerage house E-Trade is another customer. New Relic monitors all of their new infrastructure supporting E-Trade’s iPhone and iPad apps. It’s business that previously would have been won by the largest of its competitors, like IBM and CA Technologies, said Moran. “Mobile is driving customers to be more accepting of SaaS,” he said.  Finally, the other booster for New Relic was the launch of its platform in the second quarter, where it now enables other developers to build their own programs on top of New Relic’s APIs. Within two weeks, 1,000 companies were serving data over about 50 plugins that hadn’t existed before, Moran said. It now has 7,850 plugins deployed.  These other companies are building useful new ways to monitor their apps with New Relic’s APIs, including the ability to query things like “revenue per transaction,” or asking: “Is my cloud infrastructure running slow today?”  The company said it had 20 percent revenue in the most recent quarter, which ended June 30, compared to the previous quarter.

"The New Vc Kids On The Block Helping Europe’S Startups To Pick Up The Pace

In dribs and drabs, the European venture capital scene has started to look gradually more like it will develop a broader range of VCs than in the past. True, the majority of European VC funds have not performed well. But I’m not here to talk about the incumbents, but rather the new breed, which are taking cues from their American cousins in looking for businesses with potential. Time and again the continuous charge has been that Europpean VCs look only for revenues first rather than product or user traction. This new breed of European VC is at least as interested in product and more interested in building companies that can scale, rather than ones which might make tidy businesses they can, for example, sell to a European telco for pennines. And that’s only to be welcomed. The latest sign of this was the recent emergence of Connect Ventures in May this year – a fund which already has £13m in the bank but is aiming to raise £30M. This early-stage venture capital firm promptly wooed Sitar Teli away from Doughty Hanson Technology Ventures. Teli made her name as one of the first champions of SoundCloud, the Berlin-based startup that is gunning to become the YouTube for the world’s music and audio generally. Teli has always been noted for her laser-like focus on product-based consumer Internet startups, also serving on the board of MegaZebra and Handmade Mobile. Teli joined Pietro Bezza and Bill Earner at Connect. For his part Bezza founded and built up Neo Network, a market-leading digital content venture that he sold to the European media group De Agostini, and Earner is a former investment manager at Amadeus Capital Partners. Connect also announced its fourth investment in London-based Citymapper, which focuses on urban personal transportation planning apps – something Apple may even be interested in given its maps debacle. Connect is already invested in Secretsales, Ondango and Space Ape Games. The fact that Teli left the venerable DHTV for what is effectively a startup VC speaks volumes. As well as Amadeus, other VCs that have seen people depart and not be replaced include Eden Ventures – which shed two junior associates last year – and Balderton Capital. Partner Dharmash Mistry recently left Balderton to pursue his own investing. These may not add up to a trend away from the old guard of VCs, but it is certainly interesting to note. [UPDATE: I should also have added the move this year by Paul Jozefak from Neuhaus Partners to a startup fund, Liquid Labs, also focused on product]. And for many, the standing European VC houses have simply made their bets for the next few years. What’s a young, hungry VC to do if they want to to something interesting? Indeed, as Teli blogged when she joined Connect, this new wave of VCs tend to be focused on early-stage product-led Internet and mobile investments; have partners that are passionate about and engaged with technology; have partners that have built their own startups; use the tech they invest in and take active roles in the companies they invest in. But Connect Ventures isn’t the only new kid on the block. Passion Capital launched a year ago , a formal fund put together by three active angels and has backed some of Europe’s most innovative startups, such as Mendeley, Duedil, EyeEm, Flattr, Mixlr and many others. Over the last year, another has been quietly building. Hoxton Ventures is the code name for investments being made by private investors Hussein Kanji and Rob Kniaz but already they’ve invested in Campanja, Tizaro, Llustre (acquired by Fab) and GoCardless – and are planning a real fund as well. Many of these new funds are aiming at €500,000 to €1 million – one of the clear funding gaps in the European startup ecosystem. Their ideas are to move fast, be entrepreneur-friendly and even often back a single founder team. Another new fund will be appearing later this year: No.1 Seed , started by Raj Ramanandi, plans to invest in technology startups in London and across Europe. Then there is is EC1 Capital , which plans to invest even earlier, at the £25,000 to £200,000 range. Another is Ballpark Ventures , consisting of High Net Worth individuals. There is aslo Playfair Capital , born of European trustafarian Federico Pirzio-Biroli. Meanwhile in the Enterprise space, Notional Capital is on its way to shaking things up with its $150 million fund. Although most of the examples given so far are UK-based, I’ve started to see other funds appear in Europe, many of which are starting to unlock cash from ‘family offices’ and wealthy individuals, as they seek to look for returns outside the moribund financial system. H-Farm and Mind the Bridge in Italy, Kima Ventures in Italy or Team Europe in Germany spring to mind for instance. Perhaps the earliest ‘new kid’ was PROFounders Capital in London, founded in 2009. But one of the last links that needs to be addressed is the link with Silicon Valley. Seedcamp is one European accelerator that has been clever at building bridges with the Valley and thus, fast-moving U.S. investors like 500 Startups. This last link could be an exciting new development, as U.S. investors start to cast their net wider outside the hype-filled environment of the valley. While new funds like CrunchFund, built by Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch, have not typically invested abroad, it’s no doubt only because they haven’t yet found the right European-based investors they can partner with and co-invest, participating perhaps when a European VC takes the lead on a new investment. Startup founders I talk to respond positively to the development of these new, faster-moving, product-focused types of funds. They are definitely overdue, and it’s time now for European founders to start taking these ‘fast funds’ seriously.

"New Kiip Expands Beyond Mobile Game Rewards To Other Apps And Platforms

 Kiip is the mobile rewards company that embeds real-world and virtual rewards so that players become more loyal to apps in an opt-in way. It recently unveiled a new applications programming interface (API) that expands its potential market beyond game developers to the creators of any kind of apps.  With Kiip, the system identifies “moments” of achievement within a game or app. It then shows you a banner ad at the moment of the achievement. If you click on it, you can claim a reward for free stuff, such as a Starbucks gift card, from an advertiser. Now Kiip is expanding its reach for new kinds of advertising opportunities for its partners.  Brian Wong, the chief executive of San Francisco-based Kiip, said in an interview that it has redefined its growth by asking itself questions over the last two years. At first, it asked, “Why do just physical rewards?” And it added new virtual rewards that you could claim directly on your mobile device. That enabled Kiip to enter the mobile rewards market and start growing.  Then it asked, “Why just games?” and expanded its functionality to other apps. And now it is asking, “Why just mobile?” And so it is expanding beyond mobile platforms.  Wong said that HTML5 support is on the way and that should open up new opportunities to go beyond mobile devices to just about any web platform.  “This is where it gets super-exciting,” Wong said. “We realized that participating in rewards and creating them was not easy in the way that we executed them.  It will do so with “spot rewards,” where an advertiser can offer a reward for any reason. It doesn’t matter if you have reached an achievement in a game or not. Advertisers can reward you at particular “moments,” regardless of whether that is an achievement or leaderboard change.  “The idea is to get Kiip everywhere,” Wong said. “We’ll integrate with any platform with web support. Anything can be a moment for a reward.”  And that should generate more revenue for the developers that use Kiip and expand the available inventory for advertisers who want to reach users. Those include food-related apps and fitness apps. Utility apps are on the way as well. The API is now available for developers to integrate into their apps.  Kiip has raised $15 million to date.

"Carrier App Stores Suck, So Japan’S Kddi Did Something Different And Is Pulling In $250M A Year For Apps

When Apple launched its app store about five years ago, the company had no idea it would become the success it is today . It disintermediated carriers from what would become a lucrative revenue stream, one that’s brought Apple more than $11 billion in gross revenue ( based on the $8 billion figure that CEO Tim Cook said the company had paid out to developers by last month ).- In the old feature phone world, developers used to have to beg and plead with the carriers for pre-install deals on phones. But these days, they just go straight through Apple’s review process or directly into Google Play. Some carriers have tried to run app stores over the years like Verizon’s Vcast app store, but they haven’t exactly been successful . Because Google Play and the iOS app store are still the main channels for downloading apps, how do carriers cope and stay relevant? Instead of starting another old app store, Japan’s second largest carrier KDDI launched a subscription program for a collection of about 500 apps last year . Called the AU Smart Pass , it comes pre-installed on its Android phones. At 5 million users per month paying 399 yen ($4.20) each, that’s up to $250 million in annualized revenue to pay out to developers. It’s definitely a unique model. KDDI partners with developers to bring apps into the AU Smart Pass but they often ask for premium or special unlocked content. For example, Japan’s hit messaging app Line, which has more than 120 million users , gives away exclusive stickers. Many of the other apps are normally paid ones. Then KDDI splits overall subscription revenues back with developers based on monthly active usage. Developers can also offer in-app purchases, but they get to keep 80 to 90 percent of revenue instead of the standard 70 percent that Google Play or Apple’s app store gives them. “We needed to invent a new model and we wanted to manage the shift from feature phones to smartphones,” said Kazuhito Shimizu, who oversees mobile business development for KDDI in the U.S. He oversees a $60 million corporate venture fund that has taken stakes in companies like New York-based taxi and transportation startup Hailo. “This is kind of like Netflix for apps,” he added, saying that consumers would get confused if there were two app stores — Google Play and a branded KDDI store — on their Android phones. The Japanese carriers like NTT Docomo, KDDI and SoftBank have been in the unique position of being able to watch and learn from how U.S. and Western carriers adapted to the shift in power toward Apple and Google’s platforms. In Japan, smartphone penetration is still lower than 50 percent. Yet, Japan has this wonderfully rich history of elaborate feature phones and gaming and app platforms that have revenue-per-user metrics that still put Western markets to shame. Still, app distribution in Japan is changing dramatically as the big mobile gaming platform companies like GREE and DeNA adapt to the rise of smartphones and as players like messaging app Line emerge as interesting, new platform players. The AU Smart Pass could be an option for larger developers that are looking to break into the market there. The pass only works in Japan and on Android phones. But KDDI is exploring how to bring it to other Asian markets. The carrier is also building out features like extra cloud storage space for photos, files and music. “It can be a first marketing channel into Japan for developers,” he said.

"Gordon Ramsay Brings Cursing And Insults To His Celebrity Chef Mobile Game

 Gordon Ramsay will be damned if his chef’s game isn’t the best mobile celebrity title on the market. He’s been working on it for the better part of two years with Glu Mobile , the company that made Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and is trying to corner the market on celebrity titles in the $30 billion mobile game market.  At Glu’s headquarters in San Francisco, the Michelin-starred Ramsay stared yesterday at 36 game developers at Glu Mobile’s headquarters in San Francisco. As TV cameras rolled, he said, “Great energy. Is this game going to kick ass?” They replied, “Yes sir!” He keeps them going until they’re out of “yes sirs.” Based on the success of Kardashian’s game, which the celebrity tweeted generated $80 million in royalties for her, other celebrities are stampeding into the mobile games market. Some of them are lucky, like Kardashian. And some are not, like Katy Perry.  But Ramsay seems pretty serious.  Above: Becky Ann Hughes of Glu, Gordon Ramsay, and Niccolo De Masi of Glu.  “All of you, fuck off, and back to work!,” he said in his signature British accent, speaking in a joking way to the development team.  Then he asked who is Glu’s best chef. The team pointed to a guy named Bravo, who looked sheepish. Ramsay pointed at him.  “You, and me, in a cook-off, when we launch,” Ramsay said. “I want to see how good your scrambled eggs are. Three eggs only. Don’t fuck it up.”  Later, with in an interview with a handful of press, Ramsay started the conversation more politely. The seeds for the Ramsay collaboration started in May 2014, when Glu acquired PlayFirst, a studio that created the Diner Dash and Cooking Dash games. Niccolo De Masi, CEO of Glu, approached Ramsay about making a game based on his celebrity personality, combined with the moment-to-moment, frenetic gameplay of the Dash games. Ramsay said he started playing games like Cooking Dash while on long flights.  “We’re delighted to be working with the most-recognized man in the world when it comes to this,” De Masi said.  Ramsay has 10.5 million followers across all his social-media accounts, and he is also regularly on television with his Hell’s Kitchen , Kitchen Nightmares , and MasterChef . When he’s seeking out a subject for a game, De Masi tries to pitch the popular celebrities who can share or tweet things about the games to get players re-engaged in the content. Glu has lined up celebrities like Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, and Nicki Minaj — with a total following of more than a billion followers on social media. That adds up to a lot of free advertising for Glu’s games — a very important element in a world where user acquisition costs are skyrocketing.  Blending Gordon Ramsay and Cooking Dash  Above: Art assets from the Gordon Ramsay game. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi  “This is a partnership that will break new ground because we have never done something this deep in a genre like this with someone like Mr. Ramsay,” De Masi said in an interview. “We have built a game that we believe will persist for many years to come. This is a unique, living, breathing partnership.”  Becky Ann Hughes said the game is built on top of the Cooking Dash 2016 engine, but it is not a reskin. It’s an all new game with all new assets that Ramsay himself has scrutinized. Tom Hall, one of the original creators of Doom, is part of the team putting together the game.  “We’re adding social to a Dash game, like chef duels and a farmers market,” Hughes said. “We also adding a mechanic that Gordon himself came up with: an inspector mechanic with ‘Wishelin’ stars.”  Ramsay said that the Wishelin inspectors will keep you on your toes to make sure that your restaurant is in great shape. He said that he wanted to “keep it real,” and to get your “adrenaline pumping” as you cook things under pressure. You can also design your own chef’s outfit.  “The chef’s role, what you look like, even before you turn on that gas, is insane,” he said. “I want fans to feel that. It’s an ever-continuing excitement.”  De Masi said the game has an authenticity about what it’s like to feel the emotions of someone running their own restaurant.  “It feels personal,” Ramsay said. “Chefs are competitive. The duels. That’s where it is a bit of a chef off. It feels like I am building a restaurant.”  Idiot sandwich?  Above: Gordon Ramsay playfully creates an “idiot sandwich” with a journalist. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi  Part of the authenticity are Ramsay’s plentiful insults and curses. He said he isn’t proud of them, but he often says things like “fucking doughnuts” and “idiots.” He once put two pieces around a chef contestants ears and asked her what she was. She replied, “An idiot sandwich.”  “Here’s the thing. I got to keep it real. There are times when I get a little more fierce because the stakes are high,” he said. “If my chefs were standing there and sending out crap from the kitchen, I’m not going to high-five them. There are some severe words.”  Hughes said that Ramsay’s character serves as your mentor through the ups and downs. If you do something right, Ramsay praises you.  “Fuck off is such a lovely word,” Ramsay said. “We can’t use it that often.”  Above: Gordon Ramsay’s character in Glu Mobile. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi  Ramsay noted that part of the fun is starting out as a poor and young chef, as he did in Paris in a neighborhood bistro in 1994. The China plates are lackluster, and the restaurant is drab. Over time, you have to upgrade everything about the place, train the staff, and oversee the production of the ingredients.  “This is a first, and I’m putting myself out there,” Ramsay said. “You start with humble gravitas and build your reputation. When I started, it wasn’t about becoming famous. It was about becoming the best local restaurant. Today, it’s a glamorous environment. It’s international.”  Asked what he liked to play, Ramsay said his kids drew his attention to the Kardashian game.  Asked why he did a game in the first place, Ramsay said, “I don’t think there has been a chef-tailored game out on the market yet. I started to cook for love, not for money. I’d like to see this game start exactly the same, and lead to building an empire.”

"Bit.Ly Launches Even Shorter Url Shortener J.Mp

 Name-shortening service bit.ly is Twitter’s default service for scrunching long Web addresses into short ones that leave more room for text in users’ tweets. Twitter switched from previous provider TinyURL.com in May. At the time, a New York Times report suggested that reliability was a problem with TinyURL. We also heard that bit.ly offered better analysis tools.  But bit.ly’s staff surely know that many Twitter users are obsessive enough over their 140-character limit on tweets that they’ll switch to another shortening service such as ow.ly to get one more character’s worth of writing space.  Ow.ly is more efficient for power users, because it only has four letters in its name: When you give Ow.ly the link you want shortening, it spits out a link with four or five digits at the end, such as http://Ow.ly/ocLa. Those links tend to shorter than bit.ly’s links.  Bit.ly’s solution? Three characters. j.mp , which uses a domain name in the Northern Mariana Islands but is meant to be read as “jump,” debuted with a blog post this morning from toddml, who I’m guessing is product lead Todd Levy.  I just got this short-but-helpful email from Andrew Cohen at bit.ly on the business side of their operation:  “ bit.ly started as an internal betaworks project. it launched in July 2008, and  has five full-time employees today.  “Our investors include: O’Reilly Alpha Tech Ventures , Social Leverage , The Accelerator Group , SoftTech VC , Ron Conway, Josh Stylman,  Pete Hershberg, David Shen Ventures , Jeff Clavier , Mitch Kapor , Howard Lindzon , Chris Sacca , and Founders Fund (Dave  McClure) . “  j.mp shaves two characters off the shortened URL, but uses the same algorithm for creating encoded addresses after the site’s domain name. A URL entered into j.mp for shortening will be shortened to the same character string as it would on bit.ly.  There’s j.mp’s next target: Knocking down the size of the encoded URL. Is it mathematically feasible? Please post a comment or email me at paul@venturebeat.com if you understand the science of shortening.

"Utorrent Making Its Way To Os X

One of the most popular BitTorrent clients for Windows, uTorrent, is slowly making its way to Mac OS X. After BitTorrent Inc. bought the company, it promised that OS X and Linux versions would be coming soon. TorrentFreak got his hands on an OS X copy and for a beta version, it looks pretty good. It has the ease and look of Mac OS X, yet the power of Azereus and uTorrent for Windows. Compared to other OS X clients, uTorrent has the fastest download speeds. One of the most welcome features will surely be a robust BT client that doesn’t take hours to load up like Azereus does. According to TorrentFreak, the icon doesn’t even bounce one in the dock. It just runs. I don’t know about you, but I’m super excited to get uTorrent when it hits Mac OS X. Hit the link for the full lowdown. uTorrent for Mac is Coming: An Early Review [TorrentFreak]

"Google’S “Smart Tv” Platform To Debut Tomorrow

  We recently reported that Google and Intel will debut their web-enabled “smart TV” platform sometime this week during Google’s I/O developer conference, with Sony as a customer. Now we have a firmer date; It appears that Google is set to debut the platform tomorrow, thanks to some intrepid sleuthing by TechCrunch’s Jason Kincaid.  Some fiddling with Google’s I/O press site URL revealed a page that was clearly not ready for public consumption, except for a telling few words: “Insert Android press release / TV press release.” The site was quickly taken down after TechCrunch reported on it.  There’s no new information otherwise, but we already know the gist of what will be announced tomorrow. Intel wants to get its Atom CPUs (currently popularized by netbooks) into TVs, and Google wants Android to be the software on top of that. Intel CEO Paul Otellini spoke at length about the company’s vision for web-connected televisions at an analyst meeting a few weeks ago, and word on Google’s television plans have been swirling for months . Google is also already testing a TV search product on Dish Network.  We can expect Google not to be shy about getting web content on televisions. The platform can potentially support streaming video sites like Netflix and Hulu, social networking integration, and even games.  As I wrote previously, it’s telling that Google may be introducing the platform at an event  aimed at developers. Since Google TV is based on Android, the company’s  mobile operating system, it will likely have a large focus on extending  its functionality via applications. Some television makers, like Sony  and Samsung, are already offering applications on their televisions —  but Google TV would open up the TV app market to third-party developers  as well.

"Hitachi To Plead Guilty On Price Fixing Lcd

Whoops. Hitachi is the latest manufacturer admitting to LCD price fixing and another win for the U.S. Justice Department. Last year, LG and Sharp also plead guilty on similar charges and paid $520 million combined in fines. Hitachi’s case involves fixing prices of LCD that were sold to Dell between 2001 and 2004. So that means if you purchased a laptop of LCD monitor between those times from Dell, you can probably raise and shake your fist at Hitachi cause you probably overpaid. The Justice Department views this as a win, We just want to know when our refund checks are coming in the mail.

"Ebay Earns $14.1 Billion On $175B Of Commerce Flow In 2012

 eBay reported its Q4 financials for 2012 today. The company earned $751 million on $4 billion worth of sales in the last three months. Full-year revenues were $14.1 billion, with a net income of $2.6 billion.  That’s up 18 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and it’s up 21 percent for the full 2012 earnings.  “We had a great finish to an excellent year, with fourth quarter results exceeding our expectations,” eBay president and CEO John Donahoe said in a statement. “eBay Marketplaces in particular had a terrific fourth quarter, with growth in the U.S. accelerating three points, outpacing ecommerce.”  Above: eBay stock today Image Credit: Google Finance  Key payments division PayPal, which has been a critical revenue driver for eBay in previous quarters, continues to do well, with payment volume up 24 percent … which, given PayPal’s fairly linear revenue structure, means that earnings were also up 24 percent.  PayPal clients sent nearly $24 billion to each other in 2012 — 250 percent more than in 2011 — and PayPal reported adding two million accounts a month in the fourth quarter, which the company says is PayPal’s fastest growth ever.  PayPal’s growth is important for eBay, as mobile payments is an increasingly growing market. PayPal put mobile commerce first explicitly in July of 2012, when mobile boss Hill Ferguson was elevated to VP of global product and saw a huge jump in mobile payments this past Thanksgiving. The company also teamed up with NCR to attack Square just a few days ago.  eBay as a whole generated $2.6 billion of cash flow in excess of expenses in the past year and is now sitting on a nice little nest egg of $11.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and non-equity investments. Not exactly Apple-sized, but certainly nothing to sniff at.  And for 2013?  eBay expects to earn $16-16.5 billion and make between $2.23 and $2.29 per share. The company’s stock is up $0.40 on the day.  photo credit: Ryan Fanshaw Photography via photopin  cc

Findings from the research that stood out as far as I’m concerned: according to InSites, the awareness for Facebook is no less than 100% in the respondents’ countries, and more than 1 billion people – or roughly 70 percent of the online population – use social networks today. Another key finding: it will be incredibly difficult for new social networks to succeed – 60% of respondents say they don’t need new social networks, and 93% say they’re content with what they have today. InSites: “Big social networks will get bigger. Small ones will get smaller.” Way more social media-related facts and figures in the 167 slides below:

"Number26 Launches Maestro Card With Contactless Payment

German startup Number26 just launched a new product. As the company is trying to reinvent your banking experience, this isn’t your average product. Number26 is launching a Maestro Card in addition to its MasterCard. All users can get both cards for free. In case you aren’t familiar with MasterCard’s product line, Maestro is a debit card with more restrictions than your usual MasterCard. Both cards support contactless payment. The new Maestro card could be a good second card to lend to your family for example. Maestro cards are supported in 650,000 locations in Germany and Austria. Compared to other banks, Number26 provides many interesting features. For example, you can block your card for online transactions, or you can block the withdrawal feature, or you can block everything. In just one tap, you can re-enable your card’s features. But the best part is that you can receive push notifications seconds after any transaction. It’s a great way to make sure that there isn’t any fraudulent activity for example. The company also released a new update today to its mobile app with a couple of new nifty features. You can now notify Number26 that you want to make your Number26 account your main account. The company will take care of notifying your employer and other direct debits. Finally, you can now manually set payment and ATM limits in the app. So far, 90,000 have signed up for a Number26 bank account. The company recently launched in 6 new European countries . It has also turned retail shops into bank branches . And you can now set up a customizable overdraft . Maestro cards are yet another nice addition to Number26. Every month, it looks like the company is adding more features to let you turn Number26 into your main bank account.

"Why Google Shouldn’T Have Censored The Anti-Islamic Video

Editor’s note:  Eva Galperin is the International Freedom of Expression Coordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Follow her on Twitter: @evacide . On Wednesday, YouTube announced that it had blocked access to a video showing clips from “The Innocence of the Muslims,” an anti-Islamic film that depicts prophet Mohammed as a philanderer who approves of child abuse, after the film sparked violent protests in Libya and Egypt. It was an extremely unusual move for Google-owned YouTube, which normally adheres to Google’s policy of only censoring content if it violates their Terms of Service or in response to a valid court order. As Google admitted Friday, despite deciding to block the video in the Middle East, the controversial video was still “clearly within [its] guidelines.” While their goal of trying to tamp down violence may have been sincere, the decision was misguided and opens the door for more censorship in the future. Thanks to its pro-free speech policy, YouTube and other Google products have become vital platforms for free expression all over the world. When a YouTube user uploads her movie, she can expect that so long as it does not violate the Terms of Service or the law, it will stay up. Because Google has chosen not to mediate content, there is room for all kinds of speech on YouTube — for unpopular speech, for voices of dissent, for speaking truth to power, for ugly and disturbing speech, and for cute cat videos. When Google turns its back on those policies, however temporarily, it is up to civil society to take notice and hold them accountable. Let’s be clear — Google hosts content entirely at its own discretion. Google is not under any legal obligation to host your political opinions, your cat videos, or anything in between. Because Google has control over such an enormous portion of the Web, when it does censor, the decision has far-reaching implications for free expression, and any exceptions to this policy should be viewed with a very critical eye. No one cares if you’re not being evil when it’s easy. What really matters is your commitment to not being evil when it’s hard. The decision to block “The Innocence of Muslims” in Egypt and Libya may have been influenced by the White House, which reportedly contacted YouTube on Tuesday and asked the company to review the video to ensure that it was compliant with its Terms of Service. No one at the White House could have reasonably believed that the anti-Muslim video had somehow escaped YouTube’s notice. The White House is not YouTube’s abuse department and shouldn’t be in the business of asking Google to check its corporate terms of service. In the end, YouTube did not give the White House exactly what they asked for, but the phone call may have unduly pushed Google to engage in voluntary censorship. While refusing to completely remove the video, they subsequently blocked it in Egypt, Libya, and several other Middle Eastern countries. It is true the White House did not expressly request YouTube to remove or block the video; indeed, White House press secretary Jay Carney has said “We cannot and will not squelch freedom of expression in this country.” But the phone call itself constitutes a not-so-subtle form of pressure and brings to mind another incident of unofficial government censorship: when Senator Joe Lieberman put pressure on Amazon and other private companies to cut off WikiLeaks in 2010. But even discounting inappropriate pressure from the White House, by displaying a willingness to voluntarily censor content when controversy hits, Google makes itself vulnerable to the “ heckler’s veto .” In essence, the heckler’s veto allows an adverse reaction to chill protected speech. Once people see that Google will waver in its devotion to free expression when faced with violence, people will begin to use violence, or even the threat of violence, to pressure Google into censoring content they find objectionable. Furthermore, placing blame for the rioting in Egypt and Libya on the availability of “The Innocence of Muslims” and framing the conflict around the censorship of this video shifts the focus away from the real problem: the perpetrators of the violence. People’s willingness to kill each other over an offensive anti-Muslim video is not a problem that Google can solve with any amount of censorship. At a time when Google should have stuck by its own policies and commitment to freedom of expression, the company caved—and the potential for far-reaching consequences remains to be seen.

"Yahoo Adds Shortcuts To Olympic Data In Search

In preparation for the start of the summer Olympics on August 8, Yahoo has added Olympic-themed Shortcuts to its search results. Yahoo Shortcuts serve up contextually relevant content from various Yahoo properties inline within the search results.  Now, whenever somebody searches for Olympic results, news, or athletes, different Shortcut widgets will pop up. A search for “Olympics medal count,” for instance, will generate the table above, which comes from Yahoo Sports.  A search for “Olympics medal China” will bring up only that country’s medal count. Searching for an athlete’s name, like swimmer “Michael Phelps,” will bring up a picture, news stories about him from Yahoo News, and stats as well. With Shortcuts like these, Yahoo is blurring the line between search results and content by offering up key pieces of data right on the main search page.  And if you click off for a deeper dive, you end up going to other Yahoo properties.  Exposing Yahoo content within search results is designed to help drive more traffic back to Yahoo—which is all right, as long as it’s useful.  Sometimes Yahoo’s Shortcuts can serve up inappropriate results as well (but it is probably being extra careful with these to avoid any embarrassment). Update :  Google is doing the same thing with OneBox results for Olympic-related searches. Update 2 :  The Michael Phelps Shortcut image above is what you currently get if you search for his name.  Once the Olympics start, athlete names will turn up a shortcut that looks like this:

"Consumer Reports: Tesla Model S ‘Best Overall’ Again In 2015

 Well, Tesla Motors seems to have done it again.  For the second year in a row, Consumer Reports has named the Tesla Model S its “Best Overall” vehicle to buy for 2015.  As the well-regarded consumer magazine notes in its summary :  For all of the impressive new vehicles released in 2014, none was able to eclipse the innovation, magnificence, and sheer technological arrogance of the Tesla. That’s why it’s our best overall pick for the second consecutive year.   The writeup goes on to rave about the ability of the Model S to update itself to add new features:  Through the course of their life cycles, cars become obsolete quickly as newer models appear with updated gizmos.  But with Tesla’s over-the-air software updates, a Model S that came off the line in 2013 has many of the same new features as one built today.  There are limitations to that capability, however.  For instance, a Model S built before mid-2014 will be not fitted with the various sensors and cameras required to add adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, and similar electronic safety systems.   And Consumer Reports notes that as more data has come in, the Model S “showed average reliability” once “teething problems at launch” had been addressed and resolved.  Still, it sums up Tesla’s all-electric luxury sport sedan with a rave, calling it “a technological tour de force, a high-performance electric vehicle with usable real-world range, wrapped in a luxury package.”  The magazine has also noted in the past that Tesla Model S buyers are more satisfied with their new cars than those of any other model, whether electric, gasoline, or diesel.  And it recently rated the company’s service experience as the best among carmakers, based on accumulated customer experience with getting their cars updated, fixed, or repaired by Tesla’s company-owned service centers.

"Popcap Survey Shows 44 Percent Of People Play Mobile Games

  Today, developer PopCap (maker of Peggle and Plants vs. Zombies) has released the results of its third annual survey of mobile game consumption in the United States and United Kingdom. And, no surprise, the number of people playing mobile games is growing.  Research group Information Solutions compiled the data, which shows overall increases in number of users, play time, and money spent on games and add-on content due to continuing strong sales of tablet computers like Apple iPads and Amazon Kindles bringing new people into the mobile space.  Some key points from the results include:   More than 4 in 10 (44 percent) of adults surveyed had played at least one mobile game in the past month – an increase of 29 percent compared to just a year ago.    Nearly one in ten respondents (9 percent) became a new mobile gamer in the past year by playing one or more games on a recently acquired tablet.    Phones and computers are the most common game devices (33 percent and 32 percent respectively), with dedicated consoles trailing behind at 18 percent.    The number of people who play daily is up by 29 percent in the last year, from 35 percent to 45 percent. 22 percent play more than three hours a week, compared to 14 percent in 2011.    36 percent of mobile gamers now own a tablet and 74 percent of the tablet gamers did not play mobile games previously.   “Mobile games continue to vie with social games as the hottest sector of the video game industry and that trend shows no sign of waning,” said Dennis Ryan, PopCap’s vice president of worldwide publishing. “Smartphone adoption continues apace and tablet adoption has added considerable fuel to the fire. Even more important, consumers are embracing the shift toward freemium games and other add-on game content purchases, driving the dramatic and rapid shift in the forms of monetization being used by developers and publishers.”  You can see the full results here .  Design is determining the winners in everything mobile. The most successful players are focusing on one thing: How to make products, services, and devices as compelling and delightful as possible – visually, and experientially.

"The Chevy Volt: An Electric Car With Its Own Ip Address

CrunchGear’s  Matt Burns recently called the Chevy Volt GM’s “ knight in shining chrome and white plastic .” Burns was not citing projected sales numbers, instead he was making the point that the Volt has saved GM by forcing the troubled automaker to “change internally and reinvent nearly ever aspect of how it does business.” In support of Burns’ thesis, IBM and GM revealed new details on Monday on the car’s electronic backbone and how it came together in 29 months, from concept to finish. Although the Volt is far from the first car with computer functionality, it is a major technological step forward for GM. According to IBM, the Volt is equipped with 100 electronic controllers, its very own IP address and roughly 10 million lines of software code.  That’s far more than its peers and, according to Robert LeBlanc, SVP of IBM’s Middleware Software, that’s also more than today’s Boeing 787 Dreamliner which features a paltry 8 million lines of code. “Think of it as a data center and computer on wheels,” LeBlanc says. Given the Volt’s reliance on its software and electronic components, it’s no wonder that GM relied heavily on IBM’s software to put all the pieces together. As explained in Monday’s press release, GM used IBM’s suite of Rational software products (which includes design and simulation tools) “to develop some of the Volt’s critical electronic controls for the vehicle’s innovative battery system, electric drive unit, and cabin electronics.” According to LeBlanc, IBM’s software allowed disparate engineering teams to collaborate, put products to the test and it helped them model and better understand how various electronic systems would interact. That’s a significant departure from the past, when GM’s engineering teams would develop components independently, with minimal sharing during the development process. Forging ahead, the GM/IBM partnership for the Volt is expected to be a template for the development of new GM cars: “We hope to extend the Rational platform to other vehicle lines. Cars are only going to be more complex, every automaker will have to deal with that higher level of complexity and interaction.” Here’s GM’s promotional video on the Volt’s computer system and its relationship with IBM.

"Toshiba Comes Out Of Nowhere With The Ultra-Slick Tg01 Touchscreen Phone

In an announcement timed quite perfectly for maximum resonance without being lost in the noise of the upcoming Mobile World Congress, Toshiba has dropped word of a new touchscreen they’ve got in the works. In our scientific survey with a finely tuned control group (Fine. It was one guy who was outside walking his dog), the general reaction seems to be “Wait, Toshiba makes cell phones?’ Indeed they do – and if the newly unveiled TG01 is any indication, they’re pretty damn good at it. In an obvious stab at the iPhone, the TG01 shares a similar form factor while upping the specs and downing the thickness. Somehow, they’ve managed to pack a 4.1” QVGA screen, microSD support, 1ghz processor, aGPS, WiFi, HSDPA, and other goodies like DiVX and Flash support into a 9.9mm thick shell. It’s a gorgeous piece, and one of the most impressively spec’d beauts we’ve seen thus far. On many levels, it outguns the iPhone. On others, it falls short (internal memory and, arguably, that it runs Windows Mobile). Is it worthy of the much thrown about “iPhone-killer” tag that some are already giving it? On a purely technical level, perhaps – but unless Toshiba unleashes some pent up marketing magic capable of emulating the hype generator that comes packed along with every Apple branded product, it’s not going to happen.

A catalog from Verizon, detailing their Summer lineup of handsets and services, has been leaked and scanned. What’s in it? A number of things. The most exciting of which has to be the Kin One and Two listed right there under smartphones. From these we can deduce that this catalog is slightly out of date. Seriously, though, the big find is the Droid 2, which we have already seen around , but which hasn’t been officially announced by Verizon. We were hoping to hear a little about it at the Droid X event, but no. They decided they’d rather leak the news to Boy Genius Report . A few specs have been confirmed: 1GHz processor, 8GB of storage, 512MB of RAM, 8 more GB in a MicroSD included, a 5-megapixel camera, and hotspot functionality. Still no launch date, but it’s all good.

"Newsela Rolls Out Library To Help Students Read Beyond The News

When Newsela was created in 2012, the edtech startup aimed to help students master reading at their own pace, specifically with news articles adapted to different reading levels. The company’s app has racked up 800,000 teachers, and 7.7 million students as users and counting, according to Newsela CEO and co-founder Matthew Gross. But when it comes to teaching English Language Arts, the CEO said, teachers wanted more than just news articles to turn their students into great readers and critical thinkers. Heading into the new school year, Newsela is offering a major new feature it calls the Library , which contains a slew of primary source material, historical and biographical content adapted to different reading levels in both English and Spanish. Reading material in the Newsela Library is the kind that’s referenced frequently in media and pop culture, for example, Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, or the majority opinion from Brown V. the Board of Education. But such documents would be challenging, if not impossible, for most students to comprehend if they were to look up originals on the open Web or in print. Here’s an example the company shared adapting the Constitution of the U.S. from the original to a 3rd grade reading level: In addition to the Library, Newsela has made improvements to its “Pro” homepage and service for teachers in districts or schools that subscribe to the premium version of the app. The tools help teachers keep track of how their students are progressing as they work through different reading materials and assessments, and quickly see where they’re facing challenges, either individually and as a class. Gross said, “We are aiming to improve reading comprehension, knowledge acquisition and reading motivation among students of different abilities.” English Language Learners, previously referred to as ESL or English-as-a-second-language students, and students from high-poverty backgrounds are an important demographic for Newsla, Gross said. The company operates as a for-profit but mission-based venture. Its financial backers include a mix of tech, and education specialized investors including KPCB and Owl Ventures , for example. Newsela has raised $22.16 million in venture funding to-date.

"Nintendo Announces Netflix Movie Streaming On 3Ds

 Nintendo announced today that owners of its 3DS portable gaming system will be able to watch Netflix streaming movies and TV shows.  The app will be available as a free download from the Nintendo eShop. But Netflix users need to have a streaming membership starting at $7.99 a month and up. The new app will make the Nintendo 3DS — which can play games in stereoscopic 3D — more attractive for a wider number of users.  Nintendo says the service will be easy to use. On an average day, more than 1.5 million Netflix members watch TV shows or movies via the Wii console. Now they can watch movies in two dimensions whie on the run. At some point in the future, Nintendo says movies will be able to take advantage of the 3D glass-free experience on the 3DS. That’s been somewhat slow in coming, but at least Nintendo came through with a movie-streaming deal. Users can watch Netflix on the upper screen of the 3DS.  Reggie Fils-Aime, president of Nintendo of America, said 3DS users can watch movies via Wi-Fi connections, including thousands of free Wi-Fi access points that Nintendo has secured across the country. To download the Netflix app from the Nintendo eShop, Nintendo 3DS users have to first install a system update that became available on June 6.

"Google Settles With Rosetta Stone Over Trademark Infringement Within Search And Ads Lawsuit

According to Reuters , Google has settled a lawsuit brought by software maker Rosetta Stone over the search company allowing people to purchase keywords within its ad product using its trademarked name. The lawsuit was filed in 2009 and has dragged on in Virginia since then. The language-teaching company says that competitors were getting a leg up by confusing people searching for them on Google. I’ve been through something similar, when someone purchased AdWords using my full name. It was pretty annoying. The case was dismissed in 2010 but reopened. The companies issued a joint statement today: Google has a terms of service that advertisers must adhere to, allowing companies to cry foul when their marks are being used. This was a landmark case that clearly ramped up the enforcement of such activity. While no money is changing hands it seems, it does look like the case caused actual change in the process for everyone. Here’s a glimpse at the original motion, filed in 2009: [Photo credit: Flickr ]

"Rapture On My Mind

 The reasons why I haven't already completed BioShock , one of 2007's most celebrated video games, are unimportant. What is important to me at this time is to write as much as I can about the game I have experienced thus far, because my infant son and my exhausted wife demand my constant attention right now. I can't predict when I may have another chance at this incredible game and even though the Internet is overflowing with writers who laud and re-laud this game, I don't want a little thing like childbirth to keep me from having my say, especially since writing about BioShock is the only way I can ""experience"" the game for the foreseeable future.     My respect for the quality of BioShock overwhelms me; I do not know where to start in proclaiming how much I enjoy this game. Back when I played the demo last fall , I already explained how the game got me hooked right away with its distinctive art style and captivating world. For all the first person shooters set in outer space or on alien planets, BioShock is grounded on Earth in the 1960s. Admittedly, this is a steampunk/alternate history 1960s where humans have the technology to build massive underwater cities and genetically empower themselves with downright magical abilities, but the world of Rapture immediately enthralled me. Lots of video games have random stuff scattered in corners to encourage players to take their time and search their surroundings. BioShock might be the first video game I've ever played where the surroundings alone convince me to slow down and take a good look around (although there's certainly an abundance of items to be found as well).  As a game environment, Rapture is dripping with style and atmosphere. A typical first person shooter game has levels that are about as interesting as a trip to a self-storage warehouse. Graphical fidelity may offer us more visual detail than when the genre was new but few game makers take advantage of that to give their worlds character. Rapture, in contrast, is a underwater city that feels lived-in, making the chaos that tore the city apart all the more chilling. Banners hang from the ceilings proclaiming the ideals of the city's founder while hand-written protest signs, discarded luggage, and corpses litter the hallways. Audio diaries dropped in corners or left on desktops deliver stories of individual residents, warnings and cautionary tales to outsiders that never reached the surface. Was there a singular disaster that drove Rapture's citizens mad, or was the descent a long and torturous process? Did the violence and mayhem come from the top or rise from the bottom? What kind of a society would stock vending machines with food, alcohol, and ammunition? These are questions I ask myself over and over again.  For all its artistic merits, Rapture is also an exceptionally well-crafted space for the player to navigate. These are not linear levels full of monster closets and constrictive hallways, nor are they labyrinthine in their layout forcing the player to run in circles. They feel inspired by mission-driven games like GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark where running straight through to the end was not an option. In the two areas I have seen thus far, the exit has been easily accessible from the start but in order to use that exit, I had to accomplish certain tasks first. The in-game map and navigation system made finding what I needed a breeze. Also, crouching and jumping are refreshingly kept to a minimum. Ever since first person shooters realized that such abilities were necessary, game designers seemed to include lots of elaborate jumping puzzles or cramped air ducts that need to be crawled through to justify those motions. BioShock thus far has entirely omitted the former and made sparing use of the latter and I greatly appreciate it.  If the world of Rapture is what's holding my attention, it is the unparalleled emotional content that BioShock delivers that keeps me up at night wondering when I'll play it again. More than any so-called ""horror"" game, BioShock frightens me constantly, and not just with cheap tricks like enemies who leap into the frame. I dread each new door I open and each new staircase I climb because I fear for what I may find next. The first full area of the game is the ""medical pavilion"" which includes a funeral home, a crematorium, and a mad surgeon who found frustration with the human form so he just kept operating and operating until he ran out of patients. This is the stuff of real nightmares, not demons or aliens or zombies. I'm already scared of hospitals and mortuaries and who doesn't get anxious about getting anesthetized, wondering if you'll wake up or not?  Beyond the thrills and chills, BioShock also offers something few other games do: sympathetic foes. Unlike the clearly insane Splicers and security automatons who attack you on sight, Big Daddies and Little Sisters are content to ignore you as they go about their own business in Rapture. While the option to rescue or kill the Sisters is one of BioShock's most talked-about feature, it is the choice to fight or avoid the Daddies that I find more compelling. Dealing with the Sisters is not nearly as emotional as the game would have you believe; whichever you choose, it's just a matter of pressing a button and watching what happens next. The characters in the game tell you that ""harvesting"" the resources in Little Sisters kills the host, but from a player's perspective you never see anything unpleasant. Your character simply picks up the girl, who looks positively monstrous with her glowing eyes, and in a flash she is replaced by a slug and you are rewarded with more power. If this is supposed to give me pause or make me question my actions, it's not working.  By contrast, the Big Daddies are formidable opponents who lumber about Rapture, emitting whale-like moans and shaking the ground (and your controller) with each step. In order to reach the Sisters, you must first take down the Daddy guarding her and that is no small feat. The stakes are high when fighting a Big Daddy and as such, the choice to fight one has much more meaning than the harvest/rescue option the game is so famous for. Killing the Splicers is self-defense, killing the Sisters is abstract, but killing a Big Daddy is deliberate and in the end, they crumple to the ground with more of a whimper than a roar. The Little Sister he was guarding will run to his side and tearfully plead ""Wake up, Mr. Bubbles!"" Enemies that leave behind grieving children? That's the most powerful moment I've seen in a video game since Aerith died in Final Fantasy VII .  If I were to complain about BioShock , I would point out that there are some minor oddities with the controls that can lead to confusion. The SQUARE button both reloads your equipped weapon/ability and will begin the hacking mini-game when near certain machines. Since the window to hack machines can be brief, this has resulted in a lot of unnecessary reloads because I pressed the button too soon (or too late). Likewise, the X button is the generic ""interact"" button and is used both for searching objects/enemies and for picking up items. Holding the X button will replay the most recently discovered diary entry in your inventory. In tight spaces, the multipurpose nature of this button can lead to frustration. Say I pick up a diary that is on a shelf with other items. I cannot listen to it until I look away from everything else and press X or else I will start picking up items or searching random boxes.  Of greater concern to me over the long-run of the game is the combat, which is not particularly engaging thus far. The enemies may have lots of personality and talk to themselves for extra creepiness, but they are not very clever. They do not so much as ""take cover"" as run in circles, occasionally disappearing behind an obstacle only to emerge from the other side. Thanks to their manic shouting, they are easy to get the jump on and they almost never ambush me. However, because new Splicers will turn up in areas I previously cleared, the tension level of the game is well-served by their blabbering. I can never feel safe in Rapture; no matter how many maniacs I put down, more will come to loot their bodies and attack me.  That raises another one of BioShock's elements of intrigue: who am I? The nature of a first person shooter is such that I cannot see my on-screen avatar; instead, I see the game world through his eyes. Yet nearly all games in the genre celebrate the hero on the cover of the box, in the main title screen or through cut scenes. Wolfenstein 3D and Doom , two of the most influential first person shooters, even included the character's face in the heads-up display. BioShock does none of these things. I have no idea who my character is, what he looks like, nor do I even know his name. He had a single line of dialogue at the start of the game, but since then he has been silent. The only hints I have received so far are the photo of his parents he was looking at on the plane and the curious tattoo on his wrist. This clever embedded mystery is yet another factor that keeps me chomping at the bit to proceed further into this world.  I could probably go on discussing minutiae but I feel like I've said what needs to be said: BioShock is an excellent video game. In a market that is absolutely swamped with first and third person shooters with increasingly interchangeable characters, settings, and stories, BioShock stands apart with its unique ideas and rich storytelling. There was once a time when all first person shooters were known as "" Doom -clones"" because they sought to emulate the success of that title so closely. This name fell out of favor as new ideas crept in and the genre developed. If we video gamers are lucky, we can expect some BioShock clones in our future, and I very much look forward to seeing where the genre goes from there.

"Shantae Developer Crowdfunding Sequel For Xbox One, Playstation 4, And More

 Developer WayForward Technologies is currently working on Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON’T KNOW!, Regular Show: Mordecai and Rigby in 8-Bit Land, and Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse … but the busy studio has another project it wants to get started on.   WayForward began a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter today for Shantae: Half-Genie Hero. The platformer is a sequel to the original Shantae for Game Boy Color, and WayForward plans to release it for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Steam.  The developer is asking for $400,000. Shantae: Half-Genie Hero will feature high-definition visuals — a first for the series.  Check out WayForward’s pitch video below:   WayForward typically works on licensed titles and is probably best known for the recent DuckTales: Remastered as well as Contra 4 on the DS. Shantae is one of the studio’s original properties. The original game debuted on Game Boy Color in 2002 and many consider it a cult classic. The company released a sequel, Shantae: Risky’s Revenge, for the DS in 2010.  The other upcoming Shantae game, Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse, is still due out “this winter,” according to WayForward’s Kickstarter page.

"Valve Delays The Touchpad-Happy Steam Machine Controller

The future of gaming will have to wait. Valve has pushed the Steam Machines’ novel controller release from 2014 to 2015. Essentially, it will be released when Steam thinks its ready and not a minute before. Smart. Hardware rarely recovers from a rocky launch. The minimum viable product has to be free of bugs and full of enjoyment — especially from an unknown hardware maker like Valve. The Steam Machines next-gen controller needs to be awesome from launch day. The word came from a blog post detailing the Machine’s controller development, which also reports “everyone from industry professionals to die-hard gamers to casual gamers” are testing the system with wireless controllers. Progression to live testing is a good sign. Valve itself is focusing on the controller rather than the actual gaming systems. Besides a building prototype reference system , that task was outsourced to trusted PC makers such as Dell’s Alienware, Asus and several others. Unlike traditional gaming PCs, Valve’s in-house SteamOS will power the boxes, giving them a console-like user experience free of the pains of a normal desktop OS. These systems from 3rd parties could be released prior to the Steam Controller, but without a halo product like the innovative controller, the launch would be rather lackluster. Of course gamers shouldn’t have expected anything less. Valve doesn’t launch; it delays.

"Autodesk Buys Illuminate Labs, Maker Of Lighting Technology For Game Development

Design, engineering and entertainment software juggernaut Autodesk has agreed to acquire  Illuminate Labs , a privately held maker of lighting technology for game development headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden. The company’s Beast middleware solution and Turtle plug-in for Autodesk Maya software enable faster iteration on a game’s creative intent, and more realistic in-game lighting. Terms of the transaction remain undisclosed, but it’s likely nothing terribly material for NASDAQ-listed Autodesk, which said the transaction is expected to have zero impact on previously issued guidance. Based on this quote from Marc Stevens, VP Games, Autodesk Media & Entertainment, it looks like all Illuminate Labs employees will be transitioning to Autodesk: Autodesk says it plans to develop and sell Illuminate Labs’ technology and support its customers , which include leading game developers like Sony Computer Entertainment, EA, Nintendo and THQ/Heavy Iron. While Autodesk anticipates that Illuminate’s Beast middleware will continue to be licensed as a standalone product, Turtle will not, although the company added that it intends to incorporate the product into future offerings.

"Nest Rumored To Be Moving Into Audio As It Expands Further Into The Home

Smart home gadget maker Nest is looking for someone to lead what they are calling Nest Audio , fueling speculation that they are moving into speakers and other audio products. The company declined to comment on the new division or job listing. Co-founder Matt Rogers once told me that the company looks for household items that need to be reinvented. So far that has been the thermostat and smoke detector but simply releasing a boombox or Sonos-lookalike doesn’t fit that mold. A Nest Audio product is likely something that integrates into the Internet of Things – perhaps a home automation system that listens to you while “speaking” data and playing music. This is a new frontier for Nest. The company has so far utilized little audio in its products. Instead, Nest has so far recruited a couple of audio companies to join Nest’s world of Internet of Things through the “Works With Nest” developer program. “Google will help us fully realize our vision of the conscious home and allow us to change the world faster than we ever could if we continued to go it alone. We’ve had great momentum, but [Google] is a rocket ship,” said co-founder Tony Fadell when Google bought the company. Nest always had big plans outside of thermostats. Even before the company joined Google, the company had 100 patents granted in late 2013– 200 filed and still another 200 waiting to be filed. “This is what you have to do to disrupt major revenue streams,” Fadell said. Given the timing of the job listing, it’s highly unlikely that Nest’s next product will involve audio. The job listing states the person hired would develop the roadmap for Nest Audio products in the future, a future in which everything – from your front door lock to your toaster – could be talking to you.

"Wired Says Apple Tablet Will Not Use Apps For Content Delivery

 HTML5 and iTunes will form the centerpieces of Apple’s new content strategy, Wired reports in an article that claims an insider source.  “The new iTunes content will not be packaged as apps sold through the App Store,” Wired claims, “though Apple will likely provide a tablet app for displaying new content created with this new platform, and developers will still be free to create apps.”  Instead, HTML content will be presented similar to the way iTunes currently presents enhanced music and video content, according to a source Wired calls “a technologist with close ties to Apple.”  “The focus is going to be on content creation and participation,” the source told Wired.com. “If the tablet is going to be an answer to things like the Kindle, which are purely about consumption, what you’re going to see is Apple is going to be full-blown about creation.”  This strategy, if true, would jibe with a large movement among Internet content developers to use HTML5 to deliver their content through browsers built into computers, phones, airplane seats, and any other hardware. Google VP of Engineering Vic Gundotra is the movement’s most high-profile evangelist. At VentureBeat’s MobileBeat conference last year, Gundotra stood at odds with Nokia executive Tero Ojanperä, who said Nokia’s success was partly due to not requiring every phone to be powerful enough to run a cutting-edge browser.

"Make Amap Of Your Best Arguments

Sometimes the easiest way to convey an argument is with a diagram.  UK-startup Team Rubber has come out with a nifty embeddable widget called aMap that lets you make a diagram of any argument with supporting logic in an interactive mindmap.  The widget lets you flit from one point to another. For instance, in the aMap below an argument is made that Apple will flourish without Steve Jobs (because he “turned his personality traits into business processes” and Pixar does fine without him).  You can argue anything. Blog or Twitter?  Cat or Dog? (see below). You can also reply to make a counterargument (“Apple Will Be Set Adrift Without A Strong Leader”).  But here is where aMap breaks down.  Instead of incorporating the reply into the original mindmap, it creates a new one at a new URL, with a link below the original one in the list of replies.  That will just encourage forking arguments.  It would also be better if you could vote the best aMaps up. Right now, aMap only lets users map out their own arguments rather than see the relationships between arguments, although that is a direction the company may go in the future. It is also planning to add geo-data to map out arguments around the world. Team Rubber plans to showcase its themed maps at the SXSW conference this year. The company is using these widgets to sell printed aMaps.  Someone please make an aMap explaining why relying on print revenues may be quaint, but is not a good idea. http://www.amap.org.uk/viewer.swf http://www.amap.org.uk/viewer.swf http://www.amap.org.uk/viewer.swf

"Dish Beats In Q2, But Its Streaming Service Sling Tv Isn’T Helping Stem Subscriber Loss

Dish Network finally offered some insight into the traction of its over-the-top streaming TV service, Sling TV , in its second-quarter earnings. The company reported for the first time that Sling TV had reached 169,000 subscribers by the end of March 2015 – a figure that roughly falls in line with earlier reports of the company topping the 100,000 mark that same month. The company didn’t provide details on how many subscribers it had by end of June, though other estimates put the service at around 250,000. Dish said that its net pay-TV subscribers – a number which, also for the first time, now includes Sling TV subscribers – fell by 81,000 in the second quarter despite the company adding 683,000 new subscribers during the April through June timeframe. Meanwhile, at the quarter’s close, Dish said it had 13.9 million pay TV subscribers, down from 14.05 million in the same period last year. The company did beat Wall Street’s expectations by increasing its revenue and net income, with average revenue per users up to $87.91, up from $84.15 a year ago. Its Q2 revenue was up 4 percent to $3.83 billion, compared with $3.69 billion in the year-ago quarter. And net income rose 52 percent to $324 million. Its earnings per share were 70 cents, beating analysts’ estimates of 45 cents. But what these figures mean is that even though the company is losing subscribers, Dish’s remaining customers are paying more per month for their service. This is notable given that the Sling TV streaming service is significantly cheaper at just $20 per month for the core bundle, with add-on packages that start at $5 per month. But how long will this trend continue to be the case, as more satellite TV subscribers cut the cord, or move to other services – is still unclear. Dish lost 134,000 net satellite subscribers in Q1, and 81,000 net “pay TV’ subscribers in Q2. Sling TV may be helping Dish retain some of its customers, but it’s just as likely that its subscriber numbers are coming from those who were never before a Dish customer. Sling TV, which launched in January, is being marketed to a new generation whose fed up with pay TV and its expensive, overstuffed bundles. To some extent, this may include cord cutters – like those leaving Dish’s satellite TV service. but it also may have some appeal to the so-called “cord-nevers” – those who never subscribed to pay TV in the first place. For Sling TV to be competitive, and therefore for Dish to be successful in the long run, it won’t only need to capture those abandoning their satellite subscriptions, but it will also need to appeal to this second group who didn’t see the need to ever pay for TV. That’s where Dish will face challenges, as the company already has competition from streaming service heavyweights like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, as well as niche services, HBO, Showtime and even other pay TV providers like Comcast, which are launching their own over-the-top plays. In addition, on the satellite side of the business, competitor DirecTV merged with AT&T, and is providing bundled service. Dish does not offer that option. The company noted, though, that Sling TV customers are less expensive to acquire, because there’s no customer hardware involved as with its satellite TV service. With Sling TV, users simply stream live TV to their PCs, mobile phones, tablets, or streaming TV players, like Roku.

"Dji Upgrades Its 4K Handheld Gimbal Camera With Zoom Lens, Motion Timelapse

DJI just announced an upgraded version of its lovely Osmo camera. Called the Osmo Plus , this model offers key features not found on the original Osmo such as zoom, motion timelapse and an improved stabilization system. Like the original, which is still available, the Osmo Plus gives shooters a stabilized camera system thanks to the 3-axle gimbal system. It’s similar to the gimbals used on DJI’s drones, but inverted and attached to a handle. Because of this gimbal, the camera can produce smooth shots even while the camera is being moved around or attached to something like a bike or car. The addition of the zoom in the Plus model is a welcomed add-on. I have the original Osmo and find it a compelling device, but the lack of zoom makes it feel on par with the camera found on my iPhone. The Osmo Plus sports a 7x zoom with 3.5x optical and 2x digital lossless when shooting at 1080p. DJI notes this system is similar, but not interchangeable, with the Zenmuse Z3 camera just announced for the Inspire 1 drone. The Osmo Plus will retail for $499 or $649 when bundled with the handle.

"Facebook Shows Developers Some Love With New Alerts System

  Facebook is rolling out Developer Alerts, a way for developers to keep tabs on their Facebook apps via email and Facebook notifications.  The new alerts cover a range of key communiques, such as notifications of upcoming API changes, status updates for new app submissions, and communications about the social network’s policies.  The whole system is part of Facebook’s recent wave of attempts to give developers what they need and specifically request. In this case, the company said devs were asking for more and better communication.  “Most developers won’t receive alerts very frequently, but when you do we hope you find them a helpful way to understand and track issues with your app,” writes Facebooker Min-Young Wu today on the company blog .  “We’re beginning to roll this out to apps today and plan to enable it for all apps in the coming weeks.”  Special alerts will go out when Facebook is planning changes that might break your app. You’ll get notifications 90, 60, and 30 days before the change goes into effect until you’ve enabled the necessary migration.  For clarity’s sake, app alerts are going to be threaded by issue and will include links if you need to get more information or take an action. Notifications will also be sent out when an issue is resolved.  Top image courtesy of Hasloo Group Production Studio , Shutterstock

"Aardvark Co-Founder Max Ventilla Departs Google To Read A Lot Of Books On Education

One of the early proponents of social search and part of Google’s social team has left the company, and he has a big reading list ahead of him. Max Ventilla, co-founder of early social search company Aardvark and recent member of the Google+ team, had his last day at Google yesterday. And given the content of the books he’s reading , we can probably expect him to start something new in the education sector. Ventilla is a two-time entrepreneur who sold his last company, Aardvark, to Google. He was early in the social search game, founding Aardvark in 2007 and raising $7.5 million in a round led by August Capital. Aardvark was a social search application with a strong location-based component. The app presented users with a chat-like interface that allowed them to ask questions to self-described topic experts and everybody in their social graph. The departure comes three years after Google acquired Aardvark and about a year-and-a-half after the service was shut down . Since then, Ventilla has been working on Google+ as a senior product manager, helping the search giant build its own social network. He’s also been an active angel investor , writing checks for startups such as Wavii, Apportable, Trulia, Trickplay, Good Eggs, Broadstreet Analytics, Lux Dulux, and Golocal, among others. While it’s not clear what Ventilla’s next move is, it’s clear that education is a big focus for the entrepreneur. With titles like “How Children Succeed” and “Redesigning Accountability Systems For Education” on his reading list, we can expect him to maybe build something to help improve our education system as part of his next project. Or at least maybe help advise a startup that is doing that.

"Online Retailers Are Still Trying To Lure You In With Search, Says Forrester

 Online retailers are putting most of their marketing budget into search.  Research group Forrester and Shop.org released a report today on the state of online retail and how retailers are spending their marketing dollars.  Selling stuff online is a big business. E-commerce sales are predicted to reach $258.9 billion in 2013 and continue growing. But the e-commerce landscape is fragmented, and reaching relevant consumers remains a struggle for online retailers of all sizes.  In this survey, Forrester looked at how these companies are sending their marketing budgets. Paid search represents the largest areas of budget for web marketers. Changes to Google’s search algorithm and device usage fragmentation have made it more difficult to rely on organic search, and respondents said that search engine optimization was their strongest customer acquisition tool. Retailers are also allocating more money for Google paid listings now that the shopping feed is now made up entirely of ads.  E-mail is also a leading focus area. Retailers reported that more than 40 percent of their e-mail to customers gets opened on mobile devices and a majority of retailers are optimizing their e-mail for these channels.  Retailers are still paying attention to social media, although more in an effort to tell and distribute “brand stories” than drive direct sales. More than half of retailers surveyed are spending more in 2013 on Facebook initiatives than last year, one in three are increasing their spend on Pinterest, and one-in-four are raising their budgets for Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. Online retailers are also placing a greater emphasis on using big data to make decisions.  Mobile devices are reshaping the e-commerce landscape, as consumers can increasingly be reached through their phones and tablets. While companies are adapting their paid search and e-mail strategies to this shift, Forrester found that a majority of retailers have resisted trying other tactics like in-store mobile targeting and location-based programs, mobile coupons, and QR and bar codes. Few retailers have reported success with these types of experiments thus far, but it is still early days and these strategies and technologies are still being figured out.  The survey received 65 responses across a range of industries including apparel, footwear, general merchandise, home furnishings, and personal care. Fifty-nine percent of the participants were store-based retailers, 13 percent were web-based retailers, 11 percent were selling direct to consumers, and 16 percent were “other,” meaning catalog-based or multichannel. Thirty-four percent of respondents generated more than $100 million in direct sales from their web channels in 2012; 30 percent generated $25 million to $100 million; and 36 percent generated less than $25 million.

"Car Battery Makers, Johnson Controls, Building A $150 Million Recycling Plant In South Carolina

Automotive parts and batteries manufacturer, Johnson Controls Inc., broke ground on a new battery recycling plant in Florence, South Carolina, today. Local and national environmental groups there reached consensus with the company on air emissions standards in August 2010, allowing the company to embark on its plans to build a $150 million facility, taking up about 36 acres of a 270-acre property. The permits represent the first in about twenty years given to “a new, fully integrated battery recycling facility in the United States,” multiple spokespersons from Johnson Controls have noted . The battery recycling center news follows Johnson Controls’ introduction (at the Detroit auto show earlier this month) of a new lithium-ion battery for electric and hybrid vehicles, which was manufactured in Holland, Michigan . Johnson controls is producing the lithium-ion batteries, domestically, with French partner Saft. Ford agreed to buy the made-in-Michigan batteries for use in their electric and hybrid vehicles. A $299.2 million grant in 2009 through the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act incentivized Johnson Controls to build its domestic factories that namely produce nickel-cobalt-metal battery cells and packs, and battery separators (with partner Entek) for hybrid and electric vehicles. Johnson Controls’ battery recycling business in South Carolina was not subsidised by the same, federal stimulus grants, however. Of the $2.4 billion spent on the program to “accelerate the manufacturing and deployment of the next generation of US batteries and electric vehicles,” just $9.5 million went to a recycling business, TOXCO Inc. in Anaheim, California.

"Waze Downplays Exploit That Let Researchers Track Users

Waze has responded to security concerns raised yesterday in a Fusion report documenting an exploit found by UC Santa Barbara researchers. In short: it’s legit, but not as dire as it’s made out to be. “We appreciate the researchers bringing this to our attention and have implemented safeguards in the past 24 hours to address the vulnerability and prevent ghost riders from affecting system behavior and performing similar tracking activities,” read the Waze blog post addressing the issue. The company pointed out, however, that the reporter had given the researchers her username and starting location (a nice head start), and that the exploit only worked when the app was open and active — at which point your location is being shared with people around you anyway. You can also defeat the exploit by turning on “invisible mode,” which seems like the first step you’d want to take if you were worried about being tracked. More details on the exploit and others like it will be presented by the researchers at MobiSys in June.

"Ask A Vc: Rock Health’S Halle Tecco

Editor’s Note : Christine Magee is an editor for CrunchBase. Halle Tecco is the founder and managing director of Rock Health , a digital health-focused seed fund. Rock Health has backed over 55 healthcare tech startups in the past four years including Omada Health , Doctor on Demand and Augmedix . Everyone’s been talking about wearables this year – it’s estimated that 10M activity monitors were sold in 2014 alone. What’s the next phase in wearable tech? We did some research around wearables in the spring of 2014, and we noticed that venture funding of wearables grew 5 times from 2011 to 2013. So there was this record number of deals done in the wearable space, and obviously there was also a concurrent rise in sales of these wearables (that was really led by Fitbit). All of the original wearables were pretty much activity trackers taking simple measurements — but we see these as a gateway to something more. We are starting to see some really interesting technology that is more biosensing, using micro-needles to get into the interstitial fluids in a noninvasive way, or measuring new sources of data like your breath – like Spire , for instance. And then there’s a company called Empatica that’s trying to predict seizures. So having perhaps more of a clerical focus is where we see all of this technology going. And of course there’s the Google contact lens for non-invasive glucose monitoring — that one’s very cool, and the inventor of that technology recently went over to Amazon, so who knows what Amazon’s going to be doing. But all of these tech giants are starting to invest in this space, which is fantastic. When we talk about health and activity trackers, it seems like we forget about the massive amount of personal data involved. Should we be concerned about where this data is going? You’re right – there is a type of person who is concerned about that. Me personally? First of all, I can’t imagine how the data would be used against me. If someone’s going to steal my health data — to what end? My employer’s not allowed to fire me for that, my insurance company isn’t allowed to increase my payments because of that.. I don’t see a motivation to steal it, so personally I think that’s the wrong way to look at the problem. I think it’s something we have to consider in any sort of technology, but to me, the worst case here would be that someone is too afraid to use this technology and in turn they don’t learn more about themselves. We call this citizen science — if we have more data we can find more answers. The downside is much higher if someone steals my ATM card than if they steal my Misfit data. I know the gadgets are more fun to talk about, but how many of the companies that you’re working with have some sort of social impact aspect to them? One interesting example is Oscar Health now offering Misfit Flashes to their members, and if they wear them they get discounts every month on their health insurance. I think that’s huge — that’s really aligning the incentive for patient care with financial rewards. That’s not necessarily social impact for really low-income people, but I’m optimistic that those sort of incentives are going to work. Imagine if Medicare/Medicaid did something like that and was able to offer incentives to their members. AARP is also doing interesting stuff, they’re testing some wearables in the market for the 55+ age group, and testing the impact that just being aware of your activity will have on changing behavior in this group that is less tech-savvy than the 20 somethings that traditionally buy these wearables. According to CrunchBase data, a number of Rock Health’s companies have gone on to raise follow-on funding from corporate VCs. Should we expect to see an increase in corporate venture activity in the next year or two? In wearables in particular what’s interesting is that the medical device companies have been building very complex devices for decades, and if they can figure out how to innovate they’re very well positioned help build very sophisticated wearables. In digital health in general, corporates are always a few years behind. They need to learn, they need to create a strategy, they need to get a thousand people to agree with that strategy… but we’re really starting to see them pick up. A lot of very traditional health companies, whether that’s Blue Shield of California or United Heath Care, are starting to realize that they can grow and they can innovate by investing in these companies. Most recently there was a VC fund set up as a joint venture between Qualcomm and Novartis , and I thought that was a really interesting kind of coming together of the two pieces that make up digital health. What’s one trend in the digital health space that’s particularly exciting to you right now? One of the big trends that we’re really bullish about is the concept of digital medicine. If you break down medicine into diagnosing things and treating things, there are a lot of places within that sector where technology can drastically reduce cost and increase access. We have a company called Neurotrack that can detect Alzheimer’s just using software — it uses the camera on your laptop to watch your eye movements as you take a couple of tests online and then tells you your chances of Alzheimer’s sooner than anything else on the market. Since it’s software-based, the cost is next to nothing, and it’s doing something that no one’s ever been able to do before. Generally when someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, it’s just too late for any treatment to be effective, and for that reason we haven’t been able to find a cure. If you’re able to know 10 years before that someone’s going to get Alzheimer’s, you can try more drugs to see what’s going to be effective. That’s on the diagnosis side, which I think is fascinating. What are you still looking for? My colleague always says we’re looking for the health app that’s going to be on the home screen of your iPhone, something that you use so often and that’s so important to you that it’s on your home screen right in between Facebook and Venmo. I know that’s a very vague answer, but I’m personally very excited about healthcare breaking down hospital walls and becoming something that consumers can manage on their own and not just dependent on doctors who are pretty expensive and pretty difficult to get to. We still don’t have that Apple of healthcare, that brand that we love and that we really respect and trust — that’s what we’d like to see.

"Fbi Trick For Breaking Into Iphone Likely To Leak, Limiting Its Use

 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters, Joseph Menn) – The FBI’s method for breaking into a locked iPhone 5c is unlikely to stay secret for long, according to senior Apple Inc engineers and outside experts.  Once it is exposed, Apple should be able to plug the encryption hole, comforting iPhone users worried that losing physical possession of their devices will leave them vulnerable to hackers.  When Apple does fix the flaw, it is expected to announce it to customers and thereby extend the rare public battle over security holes, a debate that typically rages out of public view.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation last week dropped its courtroom quest to force Apple to hack into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, saying an unidentified party provided a method for getting around the deceased killer’s unknown passcode.  If the government pursues a similar case seeking Apple’s help in New York, the court could make the FBI disclose its new trick.  But even if the government walks away from that battle, the growing number of state and local authorities seeking the FBI’s help with locked phones in criminal probes increases the likelihood that the FBI will have to provide it. When that happens, defense attorneys will cross-examine the experts involved.  Although each lawyer would mainly be interested in whether evidence-tampering may have occurred, the process would likely reveal enough about the method for Apple to block it in future versions of its phones, an Apple employee said.  “The FBI would need to resign itself to the fact that such an exploit would only be viable for a few months, if released to other departments,” said Jonathan Zdziarski, an independent forensics expert who has helped police get into many devices. “It would be a temporary Vegas jackpot that would quickly get squandered on the case backlog.”  In a memo to police obtained by Reuters on Friday, the FBI said it would share the tool “consistent with our legal and policy constraints.”  Even if the FBI hoards the information – despite a White House policy that tilts toward disclosure to manufacturers – if it is not revealed to Apple, there are other ways the method could come to light or be rendered ineffective over time, according to Zdziarski and senior Apple engineers who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The FBI may use the same method on phones in cases in which the suspects are still alive, presenting the same opportunity for defense lawyers to pry.  In addition, the contractor who sold the FBI the technique might sell it to another agency or country. The more widely it circulates, the more likely it will be leaked.  “Flaws of this nature have a pretty short life cycle,” one senior Apple engineer said. “Most of these things do come to light.”  The temporary nature of flaws is borne out in the pricing of tools for exploiting security holes in the government-dominated market for “zero-days,” called that because the companies whose products are targets have had zero days’ warning of the flaw.  Many of the attack programs that are sold to defense and intelligence contractors and then to government buyers are purchased over six months, with payments spaced apart in case the flaw is discovered or the hole is patched incidentally with an update from the manufacturer, market participants told Reuters.  Although Apple is concerned about consumer perception, employees said the company had made no major recent changes in policy. Instead, its engineers take pride in the fact that a program for breaking into an iPhone via the web was recently purchased by a defense contractor for $1 million, and that even that program is likely to be short-lived.  They said most iPhone users have more to fear from criminals than from countries, and few crooks can afford anything like what it costs to break into a fully up-to-date iPhone.

"Dixie Kong Stars In Latest Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze Trailer

 Everyone’s favorite (and probably the only) golden-haired primate is back for a new HD adventure on Wii U.  Nintendo’s Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze for Wii U is bringing back Donkey and Diddy Kong for a new side-scrolling adventure. The game will also see the return of the premier female member of the Kong family, Dixie. In a new trailer, Nintendo showed off Dixie’s abilities in the new game.  Check her out in the trailer below:   Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is due out in February 2014 following a recent delay. It is the latest game from developer Retro Studios, which produced Donkey Kong Country Returns for the original Wii. It has Donkey, Diddy, and Dixie facing off against a gang of evil viking animals. The three major characters each have their own special abilities and add variety to the co-op multiplayer mode.  Donkey Kong Country originally debuted in 1994 for the Super Nintendo. Developer Rare produced the game and its two sequels for the 16-bit console. In 2010, Retro Studios took over the franchise and released Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Wii. It is an entirely new game in the franchise that brings back many of the elements of the Super Nintendo titles. Returns also saw a re-release on the 3DS in May. The title is known for its difficulty and chaotic, colorful visuals.

"Facebook Gets New Cfo: Genentech Veteran David Ebersman

 Facebook chief financial officer Gideon Yu left the company this spring, in somewhat strange circumstances , with Facebook saying it wanted a CFO with public company experience. Now it has one: former Genentech CFO David Ebersman.  While Ebersman worked at biotechnology company Genentech for 15 years, his experience was on the business side. He rose through the ranks as a business analyst and product manager before becoming chief financial officer in 2006 through its sale to Roche this past spring. This experience is what Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in the company press release today: “He was Genentech’s CFO while revenue tripled, and his success in scaling the finance organization of a fast growing company will be important to Facebook,” Zuckerberg said.  What revenue at Facebook? Using information obtained by ourselves and others, we’ve estimated that the company is on track to make at least $500 million this year . It only says that its revenue has been growing by 70 percent this year, and that it could be profitable in 2010. An aside in a New York Times article from April suggested that Yu wasn’t as bullish Zuckerberg, and left as a result:  Facebook said last month that it was on track to become profitable next year. But as it did, Gideon Yu, Facebook’s experienced chief financial officer, left the company. Three people familiar with the internal maneuverings at Facebook said Mr. Yu objected to such a rosy projection as the company was struggling to finance its expensive global growth.  The former treasurer at Yahoo and the former CFO at YouTube (he sold it to Google), Yu certainly had some public company experience. But Ebersman has more. Presumably, he liked what he saw at Facebook enough to join. The social network has stayed demure about doing an initial public offering; from what I’ve heard, its plan is basically working. It gets more users, gets them to share more information, uses data about what they share to target ads better — and as long as it can get people sharing even more, it can serve those ads more often. It’s not a sexy, short-term plan but for Ebersman, who grinded out a big success with Genetech over one and a half decades, it must seem like a good one.  The release:  PALO ALTO, Calif. — June 29, 2009 — Facebook today announced that David Ebersman, the former executive vice president and chief financial officer (CFO) of Genentech, the pioneering biotechnology firm recently acquired by Roche, will become the company’s chief financial officer.  Ebersman will report to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Founder Mark Zuckerberg.  He will oversee Facebook’s finance, accounting, investor relations, and real estate functions.  He also becomes a part of the company’s executive management team, which directs all aspects of company strategy, planning and operations.  Ebersman will formally start in September 2009.  “We received a lot of interest in the CFO position and had the opportunity to meet with many impressive candidates,” said Mark Zuckerberg.  “We quickly recognized that David was the right person for Facebook.  He was Genentech’s CFO while revenue tripled, and his success in scaling the finance organization of a fast growing company will be important to Facebook.”  “After meeting with Mark and the rest of the team, I was thoroughly impressed with everyone’s drive and sense of purpose to help people connect and share,“ noted Ebersman.  “Mark is constantly pushing the company forward and he’s assembled a world-class team that is achieving remarkable results both for its users and as a business.  I’m excited to join this effort and this new industry.”  Ebersman worked at Genentech for nearly 15 years. He served as the firm’s executive vice president and CFO from 2006 through April 2009, when Roche Group acquired the company.  Prior to joining the company’s finance organization, he was senior vice president of Product Operations.  He joined Genentech as a business development analyst.  Previously, he was a research analyst at Oppenheimer & Company Inc.

"The Free Gadget That Amazon Hopes Will Compel You To Order More Stuff — Lots More Stuff

 Amazon just launched a slick-looking website for the Amazon Dash , a handheld gadget for adding products to your shopping list.  “Every member of the family can use Dash to easily add items to your AmazonFresh shopping list,” reads the site. Just aim the business end at the barcode on an empty peanut butter jar, press the scan button, and it retrieves the data from the code and beams it to the cloud. Next time you place an order with AmazonFresh, that peanut butter will already be on your shopping list.  Don’t have a barcode handy? Press the microphone button and say what you want (“chocolate chips”). Voice-recognition software will interpret your request and add it to your shopping list, too.  AmazonFresh is the company’s grocery-delivery service. It’s available only in Seattle, San Francisco, and Southern California.  The Dash connects to your home’s Wi-Fi network to upload the items to your shopping list on AmazonFresh. Later, you can use your phone or computer to place the orders and have Amazon deliver the goods to your house.  Right now, the site is giving away the Dash for free — but only to people who have received an invitation via email. It’s not clear if the Dash will remain free for all, even if it becomes more widely available. But given the low costs of manufacturing such a device, and the amount of extra business it could produce for AmazonFresh, it might make sense for the company to give it away — or offer it as an added incentive to Amazon Prime subscribers.  Here’s Amazon’s video on the Dash, which features (naturally) a lot of busy parents whose hands are busy holding toddlers or making cookies.

"Why Ipo?: You Need The Public Market’S Tough Love

 You often hear about the knockdown, drag-out debates, between CEOs and their investors about when a startup ought to go public, or indeed whether it should at all. During the recent past (as in the past 18 months), it was common to hear the argument that going public was too onerous for fast-growing startups. Far better to raise more money in the private markets than be subjected to public market strictures, the logic went — and, pushed to its extreme, why ever go public at all?  The poster child was Mark Zuckerberg. The genius of staying private for as long as possible was how it worked out for Facebook. And as long as the money was available for very large, late-stage rounds, there was no reason to declare a winner in the private vs. public argument. Just keep raising those rounds, call them “private market IPOs,” and all will be fine. Until private market money is a lot harder to come by. Like it is now.  Today the question of going public is one that demands an answer. So here it is: If you are tech company selling to the enterprise and you have the option, go public. Got it? Go public.  Forget your bellyaching about how miserable the public markets will make your life. For me, that is the point. At least one of them.  You need to move out of your parent’s basement  Venture capitalists are the perfect parents for a certain stage in a startup’s life. We VCs are great – or should be — in the early stages of a company. We can help founders find their leadership legs, recruit people, and add a layer of accountability in the marketplace. We’re another neck to choke, if it comes to that.  But those companies that are even considering going public, should, if their company has grown appropriately like any promising youngster, be ready for a different kind of parenting.  They need parenting that isn’t so coddling, that pushes the company harder and expects more. That is the kind of parenting that the public markets offer. It is simply a higher bar for companies. Going public is a test and, if you pass it, a validation of every aspect of your company – your product, your business model, your value exchange with customers, and your long-term vision. Being accepted by public market investors validates the narrative around your company, why you are a leader, why you are on a continuous growth curve — in short, why you matter.  Let’s separate public market performance, the ups and downs of share price, from the achievement of going public. It’s the latter I am talking about. Stock price clearly matters, but that is something that initially investment bankers will toil over, and the market will adjust over time.  Too legit to quit  Simply the act of going public sends a very strong signal – not just to investors, but also to employees and customers. For employees, an IPO is clear validation of a company that is built for the long run, and one that can offer life-changing returns as stock in the company vests.  Those same qualities of solidity and legitimacy are important to customers, especially enterprise customers. When you’re sitting down with the CIO of  ____ (fill in your favorite massive multinational bank, transportation company, or other conglomerate), trust me, to them, being a public company matters.  They know that if you’re public there’s a certain rigor to the way you operate your business both financially and along a number of other operational and ethical dimensions. They know it’s unlikely you’re going out of business anytime soon.  As a public company it’s far less likely that you’ll be gobbled up by some larger company and that the technology or service you provide – on which they are in part betting their own company and roadmap – will get buried or cast aside. When you’re private, those things are more opaque, and it can make it harder for big customers to really buy into what you are selling.  And yes, there is the money  Initial public offerings are designed to raise capital. Too often in Silicon Valley, IPOs are viewed as some financial finish line. For some VCs, and other private market investors, that might be the case, but in the continuum of a company and for long-term investors, an IPO is really the start of financial maturity. It is the beginning of adulthood, and with that comes some real benefits.  Liquidity, for starters. Within the rules of the SEC and those defined by the company, employees can buy and sell stock. And once you are public and attract a following among analysts, your ability to attract more capital, should you need it, gets much stronger. You can raise more money when the time and the terms are right.  I don’t want to suggest that going public is at all easy. Only a very few private companies in whatever space it is you occupy will make it as public companies, and that is at it should be. In the SaaS space, the financial metrics should absolutely hew to the 40 percent rule – the idea that your growth rate percentage plus profit percentage should equal or, better yet, surpass 40 percent. But the pain and the rigor required to go public results in companies that do matter and do last. And isn’t that the point?  It has been popular to downplay the IPO option among founders and even some private market investors. Thankfully, what’s popular changes. The old IPO maxim, especially for enterprise tech companies, has never been truer than in this financial climate: Real companies go public.

"Twitter Ipo: $1B Offering On $253M Of Revenue And $69M Loss In First Half Of 2013

 Twitter finally released its S-1 IPO documentation this afternoon and will be seeking to raise $1 billion. The company has not yet set a price for its stock.  The company currently has 200 million active users, the S-1 says, and 500 million tweets a day, but with only 100 million daily active users, lower than some have estimated. In addition, tweets have appeared on over one million other websites as embedded tweets, and there were 30 billion online impressions of tweets in 2013’s first quarter alone.   “Since the first tweet, our users have created over 300 billion tweets,” Twitter says.   See also: Twitter’s global challenge: 77% of its users bring in only 25% of revenue  And: Twitter: The IPO in pictures   However, even though the company has grown top-line revenue significantly over the last years, from $28 million in 2010 to $253 million in the first half of 2013, Twitter is still not making money. For 2012, the company lost $79 million, and for the first six months of 2013, the company lost $69 million.   The shares that Twitter is offering exclude 44 million options with an exercise price of just $1.82, almost 60 million restricted unit shares still outstanding, plus almost 15 million shares dedicated to the complete of its recent MoPub acquisition, and 8 million shares reserved for future equity-incentive uses. The company’s total outstanding shares total 472,613,753.  Twitter says that 75 percent of its monthly active users come from mobile devices, and 65 percent of its revenue is on mobile, echoing recent reports from Facebook that mobile monetization is growing extremely quickly.  Twitter may be losing money, but it clearly has cash on hand, and cash to expand. The company has $164 million in cash and equivalents, plus another $210 million in short-term investments, and yet another $382 million in working capital, for total assets — with property and equipment — of just under a billion dollars: $964 million.  In its filing, Twitter is telling the world that it can be the “content creation, distribution, and discovery platform for the Internet and evolving mobile ecosystem,” combining the elements of public data, real-time information, conversation tone, and massive distribution. The resulting value proposition for advertisers, the company says, is: unique ad formats (its suite of promoted tweets, accounts, etc.), interest targeting, viral global reach, real-time advertising, pay-for-performance, and the extension of offline advertising, as on TV.  In the future, Twitter will be adding geographical expansion, more mobile apps, and more platform partners to drive the growth of the ecosystem. In addition, the company will be improving its targeting and ad platform capabilities, and adding new advertising formats.

"Dolphin’S New ‘Garage’ Opens Up 150 Apis To Mobile Browser Add-On Developers

It’s been a surprisingly busy week for Android browser makers — a redesigned version of Firefox for Android graduated from beta, as did Google’s mobile version of Chrome , and now the folks behind Dolphin have just announced their new Dolphin Garage program to spur third-party development for the platform. And how are they actually doing this? By opening up access to nearly 150 APIs that allow developers greater access to the browser’s UI as well as the URLs, browsing histories, and data from the website currently being viewed. To help celebrate the launch of their Garage program, Dolphin also pulled back the curtains on a handful of new add-ons from Evernote, Dropbox, Pocket that they’ve helped develop in response to user requests. Though they’ve made much ado about fleshing out their browser with native add-ons, that’s not all that the team at MoboTap aimed for with Garage. They also wanted to put more of a focus on their efforts with HTML5, especially after they claimed their Engine Beta was the “highest performing HTML5 mobile browser” last week. “We’ve done a lot of tuning in Dolphin for HTML5, and we want to show developers that it’s a strong foundation to build on,” said MoboTap marketing head Edith Yeung. To that end, they’ve also released a PhoneGap add-on for the mobile browser that enables it to play nice with thin-client web apps created using Adobe’s Phonegap framework. With PhoneGap support on board, Dolphin hopes that developers will create richer browsing experiences using HTML5 that can translate into the mobile space as well. As Yeung told TechCrunch, with Garage they want to “promote this sort of ecosystem” to other browser developers in hopes that they’ll follow suit. On some level though they’re already preaching to the crowd — Firefox for Mobile has had support for 3rd-party add-ons since last year, and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if Chrome for Android would get that sort of functionality down the line.

"Motorola Devour Recently Announced And Already Getting Fondled

Well that didn’t take too long at all. Just this morning, the Motorola DEVOUR with MOTOBLUR was announced , and now in-the-wild pics and hands on impressions are surfacing on the web. Pictured next to the Nexus One, the DEVOUR looks much smaller than it does in press images. So how does it feel and what can be expected from the device? It was hard to tell from prevoius leaked images and from the press pics, but the DEVOUR pictured above is made of metal. It’s hard to say whether the final release product will be the same, but we sure hope so. AndroidSPIN, the folks that got hold of the device, says “it feels very solid.” Judging from the image above, the DEVOUR is going to be relatively chunky (compared to slimmer devices like the Nexus One or HTC Hero), but the screen is significantly smaller. It’s also rumored that Motorola will be launching future devices with infrared to control home media devices, such as Blu-ray players, and that some of their future gadgets are like “nothing we’ve ever seen.” We like the direction Motorola is taking with its handsets, but we’re not going to get too excited until we see the coming line-up.

"App Annie Now Tracks Stats From Windows And Windows Phone Stores

 App Annie has been providing detailed analytics on all-things apps for a while, serving up figures and statistical tidbits on things like downloads, demographics, revenues, and rankings. But the platform has hitherto been focused on the iOS and Android realm.  Today, however, App Annie has revealed it’s introducing analytics and stats to the Windows Phone Store and Windows Store too.  App Annie initially launched back in 2010, offering support for iOS and Mac apps. Tracking was added for Google Play apps in 2012, and support has since been rolled out for the Amazon Appstore, so the next real logical progression for App Annie was the Windows realm — though it had previously supported the Windows 8 Store in beta.   So you can now dive in and see a good top-line view of what’s hot on Windows/Windows Phone, and developers can connect their apps to App Annie’s analytics for a more detailed dashboard, which includes a daily email with key metrics.

"Jackie Chan Wants Segway To Manufacture In China, Segway Doesn'T Think So

Did anyone know that Jackie Chan is the owner of a Segway dealership in Hong Kong ? Me either. The action superstar is hoping that Segway will allow the scooters to be assembled in China to help drive down the costs, which would in turn drive sales. The Segway currently retails for $10,000 in China and that’s double what we here in the US would pay. However, Segway doesn’t want any part in it because they fear someone will steal the technology and start making knockoffs. Chan and his business partner, Matt McGuire, hope to sell between 600 and 1,000 units this year in China. If you’re going to the Olympics this summer you’ll probably see staffers cruising around the venues.

"With Three New Games, Zynga Is Fighting To Matter In Mobile

 For the past couple of years, Zynga’s problem was clear. The social gaming giant dominated the charts on Facebook, but not on mobile. And as mobile gaming takes off around the world, Zynga has to break into the top 20 ranks with new hits. If it doesn’t, someone else will claim the bulk of the industry’s profits — as we’ve seen with the ascendent publisher Supercell and its Hay Day social game.  Above: CEO Don Mattrick of Zynga Image Credit: Zynga  That’s why the company is unveiling three new mobile versions of its top franchises today: Words With Friends , FarmVille 2 , and Zynga Poker . If the company scores with these titles, it will jump-start its revenues and give it room to come up with more original hits. But it won’t be easy because of serious competition from a handful of companies that have shown they have more mojo than Zynga in mobile.  These three games were in the making for a while, and they are the first real test of the leadership of Don Mattrick, who left Microsoft’s gaming business seven months ago to become Zynga’s CEO. His task is to rebuild Zynga’s greatness even as he reduces costs through game shutdowns, executive departures, and layoffs. While Zynga has been running in place, rivals like King have taken off with hits like Candy Crush Saga.  Mattrick said in an interview with GamesBeat that King’s recent filing for an initial public offering showed “pretty amazing results.” King had profits of $568 million on revenues of $1.884 billion in 2013, mostly on the success of one mobile game. Mattrick said that Zynga had been “underindexing” compared to others who are investing heavily in mobile games, meaning that it hasn’t had as much luck getting mobile blockbusters.  When Zynga went public in 2011, it had 3,000 employees and $1 billion in revenue, or about $333,000 in revenue per employee. By comparison, King had 665 employees, or $2.83 million in revenue per employee, in 2013. That shows how much more efficient, or perhaps lucky, King is compared to Zynga. Mattrick believes that the company’s big investments in mobile will help it close the gap.  “We have hard work to do, but we’re making material progress each quarter,” he said.  He noted that Zynga has generating a billion dollars in operating income during its life and reached a billion consumers in its first five years. It produced $393 million in earnings during its peak year, and Mattrick wants to return to those days.  With the $527 million acquisition of NaturalMotion last month, Mattrick acknowledged that the company could use some outside help to reinvigorate its performance.  “We expect that 2014 will be a year of growth for the company,” Mattrick said. “I’m pretty excited about that.”  So far, Zynga hasn’t had a golden touch in mobile. Mark Pincus, the founder of Zynga and its current chief product officer, invested heavily in iPhone games before monetization models and massive audiences were in place. He was disappointed with the results and went back to focusing on social games on Facebook. But as mobile grew, it chewed into Facebook, and Zynga has played catch-up. It seemed that no matter how many people Zynga threw at mobile, somebody else always ended up on the top of the charts. As Zynga’s audience shrank, it tried to concentrate on making more money on its existing players.  Above: Clive Downie left DeNA West to become COO at Zynga. Image Credit: Zynga  But Zynga still has a lot of cash and talented teams. It has plenty of opportunity to take more shots.  The task at hand is to transfer the success of FarmVille 2, Zynga Poker, and Words With Friends to mobile as the mobile versions launch during the second quarter. Those three games have engaged more than 850 million gamers so far. About 75 percent of the company’s new games are focused on mobile, and if all goes well, mobile will be more than 50 percent of bookings in 2014.  FarmVille 2, Zynga Poker, and FarmVille accounted for 62 percent of the company’s revenue in the fourth quarter. Words With Friends grew 33 percent in that timeframe. The progress is clear, and the size of Zynga’s past successes is impressive. NaturalMotion, which made heavy investments in artificial intelligence and outstanding graphics, could also add to Zynga’s mobile mojo with popular mobile franchises like CSR Racing and Clumsy Ninja.  Clive Downie, Zynga’s new chief operating officer, said in a blog post that the company is listening closely to feedback and giving players what they have asked for. FarmVille 2: Country Escape has a connected rewards system that enables mobile players to send resources from their mobile farms to their web farms. He said Zynga Poker is being reimagined as a “mobile first” game with more personalized gameplay, fast performance, and sophisticated design that reminds people of casino experiences.  Words With Friends is also getting a makeover with new profile pictures and animations, a dictionary to look up words, and game stats.  Downie and Mattrick are emphasizing a new sense of urgency to sustain franchises and create new hits. But they are doing so with a mixture of veterans and new employees, as Zynga has seen a lot of turnover as it reduced its size from more than 3,000 employees to somewhere around 2,300 now.  In the fourth quarter, Zynga showed it was able to make money in earnings before income tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and it is forecasting that the first quarter, with EBITDA of $5 million to $10 million, will be the bottom quarter in terms of profits for 2014. Besides investing in Zynga Poker, the company has also expanded its casino game offering with Hit It Rich! and Riches of Olympus slots games.  Once Zynga starts coming out with more original games, it may be able to shake its reputation of being an also-ran in mobile. And Mattrick says that the trends favoring mobile gaming are helping the company on its quest.  “People who are selecting into our category are staying, playing, and paying more,” Mattrick said. “That trend originally showed up in Asia. We saw the same thing in the console space. The second thing is, the top 20 hits are staying in those positions for longer. It’s a deliberate act, to have multiple hits and run an organization at scale. It takes a lot of time, a lot of discipline, and you have to be committed to learning new skills and innovating each and every day. That’s the culture we’re trying to build.”   Related articles   Clive Downie describes Zynga’s new gameplan (interview)

"Nintendo Says Wii Shipments Have Now Passed 67 Million, But Sales Disappoint

 Looks like Mario wasn’t enough to give Nintendo a spectacular holiday season. Nintendo reported lackluster earnings for the first nine months of its fiscal year, with both profits and sales falling because of the recession, a strong yen, hardware price cuts, and weakening demand.  Earnings were $2.1 billion for the nine months ended Dec. 31, down 9.4 percent from a year ago. Revenues for the nine months were $13.1 billion, down 23 percent from a year ago. While those comparisons are disappointing, the company is still spanking its rivals Sony and Microsoft in the video game console wars.  Nintendo didn’t provide quarterly numbers. The nine-month figures are no surprise. Nintendo had a relatively weak game line-up during the fall, with the retread New Super Mario Bros. game as its only top notch release. But everything is relative, of course. A bad season for Nintendo means that Wii games merely dominated the top ten list of best-selling games (six out of ten titles) in the U.S. in December.  The Japanese company said it has now shipped more than 67 million Wii game consoles and 510 million games. The handheld DS, meanwhile, has sold more than 125 million units and 688 million games. Those are, of course, stunning numbers. But they aren’t enough to make Nintendo more upbeat.  The company left its forecast for the fiscal year unchanged. Overall, Nintendo expects to sell 20 million Wii consoles in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, down from 25.9 million units a year earlier. DS unit sales are expected to hit 30 million and DS games are expected to top 150 million.

"Microsoft Apparently Wants Cortana To Be Fluent In British Humor

Microsoft seems intent to make its digital assistant Cortana culturally fluent. In a post today , the software firm detailed when it will launch Cortana into new markets with Windows 10, and how it will slot the tool into various countries, each of which have their own hallmarks. Cortana will first launch in Windows 10 in the US, the UK, Spain, Germany, Italy, France and China. Following, also this year, it will touch down in Australia, Japan, Canada, India, Mexico and Brazil. That Microsoft wants to see Cortana expand into new markets is not surprising or even particularly newsworthy. The company, however, has seemingly deep plans to localize the tool that go past its prior work to help Cortana fit into the Chinese market. Nearly a year ago , Microsoft launched Cortana on Windows Phone in new markets. Among those locales was China. The company implemented a number of features that focused on serving that country in particular. As it turns out, the company is willing to do similar work in a large number of markets. Sometimes companies are accidentally humorous. Spot the giggles in this: Then again, being earnest is no crime. When Cortana was a Windows Phone feature, and not a core part of the future of Windows, it seemed almost off that the company was willing to invest so much into a market (China) where you could count its market share on one finger. Now, however, in the context of Cortana shipping in every PC and every Windows 10 upgrade, the choice to invest heavily into the platform makes more sense. Regardless, Microsoft is doing the opposite of walking away from its bet on Cortana. Windows 10 drops in just over a week.

"Apple May Be Developing An App To Help You Avoid The Genius Bar

 Leaked screenshots hint at a new app from Apple that would help iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch owners get devices repaired without having to hit the Genius Bar.  Images of the app first appeared on a blog called uSwitch.com . Screenshots indicate that users will be able to report a problem and coordinate support through a live chat feature and by sending a device in to be repaired.  Customers will also have access to a support hotline and be able to schedule an appointment with the Genius Bar through the app, according to the report. In addition to providing customers with tools for contacting support, the app may host instructions for how device owners can fix more minor issues themselves.  The app (a serious upgrade from Apple’s existing support options) is no doubt an attempt to alleviate the strain on Apple’s Genius Bar and to raise overall customer satisfaction.

"Fart Fight: One Iphone Fart App Takes Another To Court

 People love the fart applications for the iPhone — or love to hate them. Either way, a lot of people are downloading them, and making the developers a lot of money . And where there’s money, there’s lawsuits. And now we have one.  Infomedia, the creators of iFart Mobile, have asked a federal judge in Colorado to rule that “pull my finger” is a common phrase and as such, doesn’t fall under trademark laws. (Yes, I’m serious.) Why? Well iFart Mobile has apparently been going at it with another fart application, one we’ve written about before, Pull My Finger . Infomedia’s Joel Comm lays out his version of the whole thing on his blog and claims that Air-O-Matic, the makers of Pull My Finger, are demanding money from him, stating that he’s publicly saying things that damages Air-O-Matic’s product.  Comm also says that Air-O-Matic asked Apple to remove iFart Mobile from the App Store, and Apple refused. If you really want to get into all of this, Comm has made the legal papers available here .  So yes, we have a fart fight on our hands — it almost seems appropriate given how popular these apps have become in the App Store. I’m not sure of the exact number of fart apps now, but AppShopper lists 165 apps that contain the word “fart” — and there are plenty of others using synonyms. So yeah, it’s in the hundreds.

"Warning: Mouseover Tweets Security Flaw Is Wreaking Havoc On Twitter [Updated]

BREAKING: Post javascript into your status update on Twitter and you can make something appear in the pop-up as a user mouses over your tweet. This is clearly now causing havoc across the Twittersphere as users either do funny, rick-rollling type stuff, or scammers catch on to the exploit. It looks like many users are currently using the flaw for a joke but cybercrims could redirect users to third-party websites containing malicious code, or for spam advertising pop-ups. [Update: it appears the exploit could also fill and submit a status update form ‘on your behalf’ leading to it spreading to over 40,000 tweets within 10 minutes. Here are our top 5 ways to avoid and fix the onmouseover Twitter bug] This is only affecting the actual Twitter web site (which has the highest number of Twitter users), not third party apps like Tweetdeck, Seesmic, etc. As Security experts Sophos put it : This is a developing story, stay tuned for updates. UPDATE 1: The hack may have originated with the account RainbowTwtr (best not go there just in case) which, when you moused over the tweet, would produce a rainbow. That probably lead others to realise the exploit could be used for other purposes. UPDATE 2: As we said, third party apps using the Twitter API won’t re-produce the mouseover exploit, so they are safest right now. It also appears that users of the New Twitter interface (mostly in North America) do not have the same problem. UPDATE 3: According to blogger Espen Antonsen , the worm was kicked off by @judofyr  here in order to just set the anchor background color to black “but his next tweet included onmouseover and people could not stop moving the mouse over the tweet resulting in over 40000 tweets within 10 minutes. So Twitter does not encode the URL and whatever is after the @ gets included in the anchor. So css and javascript can be included. Shortly after someone else created a more evil approach”. They sure did. UPDATE 4: A commenter points out a quick fix below : “Go to mobile.twitter.com and sign in. Then go to mobile.twitter.com and delete the forced retweet. Do this quick so that others don’t get effected. ALSO, don’t forget to change your password just in case.” UPDATE 4: We’ve now heard the Mobile site may be affected as well. Best avoided. FINAL UPDATE: Twitter says it is now on  the case and fixing the issue . ONE FOR LUCK: Twitter Patches Security Hole, Introduces Two Cool New Features To #NewTwitter

"Youtube Analytics Slakes Your Thirst For Your Channel’S Viewing Stats

YouTube has upgraded its viewer demographics and video tracking tools and changed the name from Insight to Analytics. The changes should be rolling out to “everyone with a modern browser” today, though you can still access Insight if you want to do a little comparison of capabilities. The changes are non-destructive; some existing features have been tweaked and expanded, and there are a few new tools that could help the struggling YouTube-jockey pull in more views and better understand their viewers. The look has been overhauled to give the stats a little more space around them, and the amount of simple clickable text is removed. The layout has been mixed up somewhat and some crucial social stats (likes, comments, net subscriber change) are front and center. Search has also been made more obvious and some drilldown controls are placed prominently. All the usual reports supposedly now have more detailed information, perhaps only of interest to stat hounds, but appreciated nonetheless. The audience retention measure looks like a handy tool: Comparing to other videos of the same length seems ridiculous (this was the retention tool from Insight), but seeing the points of the video at which people stopped watching, or had their attention grabbed, is certainly handy. Is the intro sequence too long? Did that lull in the conversation kill viewship? Good info here for people looking to tweak their content. A few more details and links are available at the YouTube blog , and if you’re logged in this link should take you to the new stats page.

"Spanish Start Up Ticketea Raises $280,000 For Online Ticketing

Though the consolidation of Web 2.0 services in the last years has changed the way we use the Internet, some online services have remained almost unchanged for the last 5 or 10 years. Buying and selling tickets seems to be one of these areas. So far, US companies like Eventbrite or Ticketleap dominate this market, although Germany’s Amiando is giving them a run for their money and Belgium’s Oxynade is gearing up for launch. Now Spanish startup Ticketea , an online service that tries to boost the traditional management of events, has entered the game, raising a modest $280,000 and will launch in the next few weeks. The company will be based in Spain and is backed by American and Spanish business angels. Investors include Jaime Diaz , founder and CEO of the NYC Investment company, Worldwide Wealth Management . Diaz is also an experienced investor in relevant Internet companies such as Digital Domain , Artica or Domin-8 . This Spanish company aims to develop a different way to promote events and sell tickets for small and medium size event organizers by levering 2.0 tools, and will try to make organizers’ life easier in six areas when it comes to manage an event: Attendees Registration, Event Promotion, Event Monetization, Ticket Distribution, Ticket Validation and Data analysis. This will be the first venture of this kind in Spain, and was set up by two friends who came across this business idea when they were trying to organise a party in order to raise funds for a non-profit organisation: the 2009 Mongol Rally. Javier Andrés , founder of the venture, initially developed this original idea as a student project for the Instituto de Empresa’s Venture Program.

"Itv To Sell This Summer, Says Analyst After Trip To Asia

  Apple just released its newest Apple TV set top box, but the rumored iTV might not be far off. Indeed, one analyst is saying the television may be released in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Peter Misek, an analyst with financial services firm Jeffries and Company, recently took a trip to Asia where he uncovered what he believes are iTV components being shipped to Apple Asia.  “We believe specialty components have begun to ship to Apple’s Asia panel suppliers with polarized films, filters, and IGZO components starting to move in small quantities,” Misek said in a report. “We expect commercial production in May/June with 2M to 5M builds likely.”  In December, the Wall Street Journal’s sources predicted the iTV would come with some nifty features . Given the popularity of the iPhone’s Siri voice assistant, iTV may come with a voice element, such as vocal channel changing. People may also be able to stream content from their devices to the television using AirPort, potentially overriding the need for Apple TV. Given the company’s deep investment in mobile products, the television could also sync programs between different Apple devices, giving viewers the ability to watch a show on the TV, pause, and pick it up on an iPad.  Misek isn’t alone in estimating a May-to-June delivery timeframe. Taiwanese blog Digitimes reported in late December that Apple would begin assembling the iTV in the first quarter of 2012 and sell the product in the summer months.  Given all the anticipation surrounding this product, Misek believes Apple’s stock could hit a high of $699, $100 more than his previous estimate of $599.  hat tip All Things D

"Global Business Diversity Goes Beyond ‘Political Correctness’

  More than a decade ago, I met an executive for lunch at a business club in a wealthy U.S. suburb. As we entered the club, the conversations grew oddly hushed. Heads turned sharply. Diners shot glares at me, as if I were a street person. The brusque maitre d’ looked blankly through me, as if I was invisible, while warmly greeting my lunch partner. My face flushed.  Clearly, dark-skinned folks – even a tax-paying, God-fearing American in a business suit who spoke perfect English – were not welcome there. How would the club members have reacted if I had a “foreign” accent? Women barred from all-male private clubs, or white males targeted by anti-foreigner sentiment while travelling abroad, know the feeling.  Luckily, times have changed in much of the United States, which is still the world’s model for business and cultural diversity. Today, a new global business and workplace diversity is dramatically changing the corporate world here and rippling overseas to modern and emerging countries alike.  Traditionally, the diversity practices of U.S. companies focused mostly on legal compliance and federally-required hiring data – a product of the civil rights era. The result? A more diverse workforce in the United States. But as the pace of globalization quickens, more U.S. and global business leaders – AT&T, Coca-Cola, IBM, Intel, Procter & Gamble, Cisco Systems, Unilever, Renault-Nissan, American Express and others – are raising diversity to a higher level than ever before and broadly redefining the concept.  Rosalind Hudnell, corporate director of diversity for Intel, calls it “the new calculus of diversity” in an interview, while Ernst & Young CEO James Turley and others describe it as a new global mindset.  Not surprisingly, technology and telecommunications giants – AT&T, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel and others – are at the vanguard of global diversity efforts. Why? Because much of the world still needs to get wired. And once the whole planet of 7 billion connects to the Internet and mobile devices, there will be 7 billion points of cultural convergence – a mash-up of people, ideas and businesses fusing in unimagined ways.  Not content with toothless mission statements and diversity policies, many companies are embedding diversity strategies into their daily business practices. They’re integrating their workforces and hunting globally for talent like never before. They’re seeking new ways of thinking and working. They’re looking for local knowledge and experience that expatriates don’t have. They’re studying different cultures, religions, languages and dialects. They’re creating hybrid teams from a world talent pool and migrant workforce of many millions.  “Smart people can be found anywhere in the human family,” Ron Glover, IBM vice president of global workforce diversity, said in an interview.  This has nothing to do with political correctness, and everything to do with business survival and the relentless march of commerce, culture and demographics. To truly compete, our workforces must reflect the world.  Beyond feel-good moral arguments for diversity, the most visionary companies know that cross-border diversity goes hand in hand with global economic growth. They know that a multicultural workforce and a cross-cultural mindset create real business value. While many continue to debate the volatile issue, a growing number of recent studies show that diversity clearly pays.  A McKinsey & Company study, for instance, of 180 publicly-traded companies from 2008 to 2010 found that firms with higher levels of foreign and women executives boasted 53% higher return on equity than other companies. “The findings are startlingly consistent,” write McKinsey principal Thomas Barta and consultants Markus Kleiner and Tilo Neumann. “These successful companies are simultaneously pursuing top-team diversity, ambitious global strategies and strong financial performance.”  In tech land, IBM, Cisco and Intel will remain global leaders in their sectors because they get the new calculus of diversity. They have: Truly multicultural workforces of all castes, colors and cultures. Strong global partnerships and alliances. Cross-border business, manufacturing and R&D facilities. Products and services tailored to a Babel of clients and consumers. “Inclusion and diversity are at the heart of globalization,” said Leo Scrivner, vice president of human resources at Cisco Globalization Centre East in Bangalore, India, in an interview.  The enormity of global change is mind-boggling, even for those who closely follow global business news. Many economic and cultural mega-forces are converging more rapidly and on a far greater scale than ever before: The growing migrant workforce of many millions. Record numbers of middle-class, multicultural consumers who are creating a new global mainstream. The fusion of popular and urban culture in hundreds of countries. The rapid rise of powerful multinationals that are challenging U.S. and European corporations.  In the corporate realm, much of the sweeping change comes from a rising breed of cross-cultural executives and entrepreneurs who are global citizens, cultural chameleons and business shape-shifters. Their cross-border leadership styles – a fusion of collaborative management practices and philosophies from West and East – are emerging as a model for the business world.  Among others, they include: Ralph de la Vega, AT&T Mobility CEO and a Cuban-American immigrant from Miami. He has made AT&T one of the strongest players in the multibillion-dollar U.S. and global market for Hispanics, among the most avid technology consumers in the world. David Neeleman, founder of JetBlue and fast-growing Azul airline in Brazil. A devout Mormon from Utah and a Portuguese speaker, Neeleman quickly gained the trust of Brazilian consumers and travelers, who helped Azul become the No. 3 airline in Brazil in only three years.  Carlos Ghosn, the multilingual CEO of Renault-Nissan with roots in Europe, Japan, Latin America, and the Middle East. Ghosn turned around the troubled Renault and Nissan 10 years ago, built an industry-famous alliance between the two, and is positioning the auto companies to thrive.  Claudia Fan Munce, head of IBM’s Venture Capital Group, is a native of Taiwan and Brazil and one of the most successful women in technology. Much of IBM’s success with 1,500 global startups and venture-backed partners comes from Fan Munce’s chameleon-like skill at blending into other societies by respecting their cultural values,  knowing their social customs and understanding their business practices.  In today’s fast-changing, borderless world, it’s easy to think that we’re not culturally biased. We jet around the globe for business and vacations. We hang with diverse friends and colleagues. We have a half-black U.S. President, a Latina Supreme Court justice, openly gay celebrities and broadcasters. Narrow-minded and xenophobic? Not us.  The truth is we know very little about the new wave of diverse business people and companies in the 21st-century economy. We’ve barely skimmed the surface.  The new era cries out for a more diverse global state of mind that transcends business borders and cultural biases. Companies may survive poor financial performance. But they’re less likely to survive long-term if they fail to know the world’s myriad cultures and people — whether a 15-hour flight away or a short walk down the hall. Whether we like or dislike the changes, the future is here. Our economic fate rests on understanding those who are different.

"Apple And Google Still Lead Webkit Development, But More Smaller Companies Contributing

Apple and Google still represent the bulk of reviewed commits contributing to the ongoing development of WebKit, the open source web browser engine that powers Safari and Chrome, among others. Google accounts for the bulk of commits, having overtaken Apple in that regard back in 2009 (though Apple still does much more with fewer authors actually writing code), but the more interesting story here is that the impact of other parties is steadily growing. Bitergia, a company that analyzes free, libre and open-source software projects, gathered data on the development of WebKit in a new report , showing that the share of reviewed commits coming from parties other than Apple and Google is at 25 percent and growing, higher than it has been in the past. Around five companies were actively contributing to WebKit back in 2007, but that number has risen to over 20 today, and the picture of which of those companies is contributing the most tells a story about changing fortunes and goals for companies building products for the web. Nokia, for instance, was once a significant contributor to WebKit, with its contribution peaking around late 2011 (which is also when the Windows 7-powered Lumia line first appeared, and when MeeGo was still a going concern). Lately, however, Nokia’s contribution has dropped off dramatically, with both its monthly commits and authors working on WebKit taking a steep dive. That may show where Nokia’s priorities lie as it becomes more of a dedicated hardware partner running more or less on software provided by Microsoft. BlackBerry, in stark contrast, has increased its contributions and authors working on WebKit by almost inverse proportion to Nokia. It’s impact has grown steeply since 2011, which is in keeping with the development of BB OS 10 and its WebKit-based browser, an element of the OS the company placed a lot of emphasis on at launch. Apple and Google are still the most invested in the development of WebKit, and for good reason, but the changing picture of reviewed commits helping the engine along means we’re seeing a more diverse set of interests represented in the project than ever before, and it’ll be interesting to see where that takes us.

"Healthy Food Delivery Startup Zesty Served $17 Million In Funding To Cater Beyond The Bay

Food delivery startup Zesty turned corporate last year and began an office catering program. The startup now plans to go beyond serving in San Francisco and recently pulled in $17 million in Series A funding to do that. Index Ventures led the round, with participation from Founders Fund and previous investor Forerunner Ventures. Zesty raised a healthy $3.7 million in seed money from Y Combinator, SV Angel and others in the spring of 2014. The startup now possesses a total of $20.7 million in venture capital to use for its expansion plans. The startup brings meals into companies on an agreed-upon schedule and works with individual SF restaurants to ensure there’s no added sugar or MSG in meals. All meals come with a list of ingredients, as well as calories per serving so that those watching their weight or wanting to eat healthy know what’s going into their body. Restaurants benefit from the service by letting Zesty handle all the delivery and scheduling logistics and then picking up a cut of the catering revenue. According to Zesty, some of the top restaurants the startup partners with earn an extra half a million in revenue per year from the service. The startup gained popularity last year after becoming a catering service to some of the better-known startups in town, including Slack, Instacart, Twitch, Eventbrite and Clever. It now serves tens of thousands of meals every week to hundreds of companies, according to the co-founders. Zesty also delivers to TechCrunch on certain days of the week. “We believe we are now the largest catering company by revenue in San Francisco,” co-founder David Langer told TechCrunch. “We are already on an eight-figure gross revenue run-rate, and we had a waiting list for the first six months of 2014 due to such overwhelming demand.” Zesty plans to use the new cash to expand that growing business into new markets. Langer did not want to disclose where those places were, but you can bet it will most likely be in places with a lot of companies and growing startups looking for healthy catering. Zesty will also use the fresh infusion to double its team of 30 over the next 12 months. The startup tells us it will be hiring across the board, but, like most of the startups around here, with a heavy emphasis on engineering.

"Follow-On Funding For Uk Startups Stalls — France And Germany Accelerate

As most entrepreneurs will tell you, it’s not raising a funding round that concentrates the mind so much as wondering if you’ll be able to raise a follow-on round after that. European startups have continually been at a disadvantage to their US counterparts on that score, but today we get some data comparing how major European markets fair. It suggests that despite the UK remaining the largest country by overall value for VC deals, France has now overtaken for larger follow-on deals, and Germany is nipping at the UK’s heels. Research carried out by DFJ Esprit & Go4Venture Advisers reveals that while the seed funding of early-stage European start-ups is healthy, there is a scarcity of follow-on capital for later-stage businesses. The data, compiled from the latest Dow Jones VentureSource figures, also reveals that while the UK remains the top European country for tech investment, it has for the first time lost out to France in terms of the number of larger deals completed in the first half of this year. This suggests that the UK regulatory regime is not incentivising VCs or private individuals to invest at a later stage for the majority of deals. While there has been a lot of activity to incentive at the early stage, little has been done for follow-on, and that will mean many startups will eventually fail. Of the $1.8 billion invested in European venture deals in the year to date, the UK holds the total investment lead at $656 million followed by France ($399m) and DACH ($343m). But, in larger follow-on deals (over $5m) the UK lost the lead to France for the first time, with 25 versus 28 deals respectively and Germany not far behind with 18 deals in the first half of the year. Despite the UK’s advantage of average larger follow-on deal size compared to France ($23m vs $11m respectively), the UK’s overall lead of 49 deals is gradually being eroded compared to France’s 46 and Germany’s 18. Simon Cook, CEO of DFJ Esprit, commented that: “The bulk of the financial returns in venture capital come from the big winners and the major investments that create these companies. What this data clearly shows us is that Europe is successfully launching fledgling businesses but there is a scarcity of available capital for the follow-on funding to get them to the next stage. In Silicon Valley the ratio of large investment rounds compared with smaller ones is over 1 to 1 – in this latest data for Europe it is less than half that level”. “From a geographic point of view, the UK is often seen as the US gateway into Europe and many of the leading VC funds in London have strong US links. But the UK’s historical position is under threat as Governments across Europe use incentives to stimulate innovation and growth. The UK needs to act now to maintain its overall lead within Europe or risk being overtaken”, added Cook. The research also highlighted how tax incentives are boosting early stage growth. According to figures from the UK government tax department (HMRC), in 2010/11, the latest year for which full statistics are available, 1,937 companies raised a total of £525m under the EIS scheme – an average of £270,000 per deal. But in 2012/13, there were 2,346 applications under the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS). This is a 9% increase from 2011/12. Additionally there were 1,729 applications under the new Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) for seed funding up to £150,000. The increases follow the changes in the 2012 Budget which were welcomed by earl stage investors. Clearly, tax incentive schemes have been affecting the early stage equity gaps for startups. However, it’s clear from the above figures about later stage, that there is a need for growth capital following the seed and start-up funding stages. Deloitte, for instance, has called for the later stage funding gap to be filled by the financial community and for entrepreneurs themselves to step up to invest in and develop these companies. Jean-Michel Deligny commented: “The UK Government with EIS/SEIS and the French Government with the ‘Fonds Commun de Placement dans l’Innovation’ (FCPI) scheme have both shown that tax incentives can boost private investment in starting businesses. But the exit data shows that the most successful companies have to raise multiple rounds, from multiple investors including large venture capital funds. Even with the increased £5m limit on EIS in the UK, this is not enough on its own to build these types of companies.” According to Simon Cook the “investment of follow-on capital has contracted in the first half of 2013. The UK Government focus has successfully stimulated investment into very early stage businesses via EIS and SEIS, however the challenge now is to ensure and direct the larger amounts of follow-on capital required to grow the winners into global champions.” It’s clear that Europe has to step up its game if it is to be able to create the kinds of companies that can go global. Time and again entrepreneurs tell me that startups in Europe are chronically underfunded compared with their US counterparts. I agree, and at least we have some data to back this up now. Startups MUST be funded beyond early stage. DFJ is right to point out that the EIS scheme has the key elements in place with EIS Approved Funds but these are not used in practice as they have fallen behind other changes in legislation. Individuals and institutional funds ought to be incentivised to invest not just at the early stage but at follow-on rounds as well.

"Loan Monitoring Startup Credit Sesame Banks Another $12M

  Credit Sesame , a credit and loan monitoring startup, has closed a new $12 million third round of funding, the company announced today.  Credit Sesame’s service is meant to help people keep track of various kinds of debts, loans, and credit funds, such as mortgages, credit cards, consumer loans, and student loans. Users can also check and monitor their credit scores, and hopefully save money in the long run. The company’s analytics engine also analyzes your credit profile against thousands of available financial products in the market to find solutions to help you save money.  The startup says U.S. households collectively have $14 trillion in credit expenses, which is why it sees an opportunity for business. The service currently finds $175 million a month in savings for its users, and manages 22 billion dollars in loans , as VentureBeat previously reported.  The new funding will be used to expand Credit Sesame’s market reach, hiring new talent, and enhancing its mobile app, the company says. The new round was led by Globespan Capital Partners, with participation from Menlo Ventures and Inventus Capital.  Founded in 2010, the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company has raised a total of $19.4 million in funding to date.  Image via 401K/Flickr

"Google Debuts Search Ads For Mobile Apps; Distance Will Now Factor Into Mobile Search Ad Rankings

As the holiday shopping season approaches, more and more consumers are going to be using the smartphones to search for products, stores and more. Google is debuting a host of new mobile ad formats today, including one specifically designed for the search experience. Many apps feature search capabilities (i.e. Yelp) within the app, so with these new formats, app developers can place contextual ads within the app’s search. Another ad unit allows businesses to use mobile search ads to direct someone right to a destination within a mobile app already installed on their phone.  For example, if someone searches for an iPad on a mobile device, they might see an ad that takes them directly into a shopping app they’ve installed on their phone. With 40 percent of mobile searches on Google are related to location, local mobile ads are a huge market.  In fact, Click to Call are now driving millions of calls per week. Along with the in-app search ads, Google is also making a number of announcements related to local mobile search ads. The search giant is announcing that proximity will now be a factor in mobile search ads ranking. So the distance between a user and an advertiser’s business location will affect how an ad performs in AdWords. Of course, the feature will be effective only when consumers opt in to share their device location for mobile searches.  This could be a big deal with the holiday shopping season coming up, with more local searches for products and stores. Google is also launching circulars, a new ad format for retailers. When someone clicks on a search or display ad (on desktop, mobile or tablet devices), they may see Circulars, which contain photos of relevant products and special offers. Users can email that circular to their mobile phones, and later walk into their local store, flash their phone and redeem the offers.

"Spotify > Youtube As Audio Streaming Surpasses Music Videos

Audio didn’t quite kill the video star, but it’s making a comeback. Americans are now on-demand streaming more songs as audio than they’re consuming through music videos. The shift highlights the importance of music in the battle for mobile profits, plus it could help artists get paid more. Analytics provider BuzzAngle Music tells TechCrunch that since the start of 2016, Americans purposefully played 114 billion audio streams on apps like Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music, versus watching 95 billion music video streams on apps like YouTube. This represents a big resurgence for pure listening since the rise of MTV. On-demand Audio streaming was up 107.8 percent in the US compared to the first half of 2015, while video streaming grew 23 percent. On-demand streaming as a whole rose 58.3 percent, and these numbers don’t count online radio streaming like Pandora. A sizable amount of on-demand music streaming is coming from paid subscription services like Spotify and Apple Music than can charge $9.99 for unlimited access. While YouTube recently launched its own ad-free subscription service, most users watch for free but endure ads. Royalties from subscription music services pull in more revenue than ads on videos, earning musicians more per listen. With royalties taking up so much of what Spotify earns, it’s waging a tough war against a deep-pocketed opponent. Apple launched its on-demand streaming service in June 2015, bringing its enormous horde of cash earned from iPhone sales to the competition. This money helps it recruit new listeners through ads and secure exclusives like the early release of Drake’s new album “Views”, which BuzzAngle says was the year’s top album. If Apple can gain a loyal audience for its Music app, it might have better luck getting those people to buy more of its pricey hardware. Spotify meanwhile just raised $1 billion in debt with dirty terms to fuel the battle. It has to hope its free ad-supported tier can more effectively recruit listeners and convert them to paid subscribers than Apple Music’s three-month free trial. Music sales continue to decline, with digital song sales down 24.2 percent and album sales down 17.7 percent. Despite vinyl popularity amongst hipster increasing old-school record sales by 17 percent, physical CD sales dropped 9% pulling down all physical album sales down 7% from the first half of 2015. Streaming Royalties still aren’t replacing what artists made from records at the peak of the $16.99 CD era. But transitioning more fans to paid subscription services could lessen the gap. The convenience and portability of audio streaming lets listeners immerse themselves in an artist’s albums, not just their popular single that has a video. Rather than flitting from artist to artist watching music videos, streaming apps like Spotify make it easier to dive into a musician’s whole catalog. That could make people more likely to spend money on a musician’s merchandise and concert tickets. The MTV age meant musicians couldn’t just make music any more. They had to be actors too. Now media is undergoing another shift. Any artist solely focusing on their recorded music sales and streaming royalties isn’t adapting. To earn a good living, musicians must become merchandise designers, live performers, social networkers, TV commercial soundtrack composers, and more. Today, musicians don’t sell music. They need to sell a connection between them and their fans by every method available.

"Chrome 44 Launches With Android Home Screen Banner Improvements, Tweaks To Push Messaging And Notifications

 Google today launched Chrome 44 for Windows, Mac, and Linux with new developer tools. You can now update to the latest version using the browser’s built-in silent updater or download it directly from google.com/chrome .  Chrome is arguably more than a browser: With hundreds of millions of users , it’s a major platform that web developers have to consider. In fact, with regular additions and changes, developers have to keep up to ensure they are taking advantage of everything available.  First and foremost, let’s talk about home screen banner improvements on Android. While Chrome 44 for Android isn’t out yet, developers can start leveraging the improvements now.  Chrome 32 introduced the ability for Android users to add home screen shortcuts to their favorite websites via a menu item. Chrome 42 took the functionality a step further by showing a banner — users who frequently visit a high-quality web app can be asked if they want to add the site to their home screen with one tap:   In Chrome 44, developers can now track to see if users added their app (Chrome now fires a cancellable beforeinstallprompt event before the banner is shown) and disable the banner completely. More details are available on GitHub: check the banner and prevent the banner .  Next up, push messaging is changing slightly with this release and the next. Here is what developers need to know :  When push was first implemented in Chrome 42, the spec also defined a subscriptionId, which Chrome used to pass a GCM ID to the web app. The spec has since changed and removed subscriptionId, so in Chrome 44 the subscriptionId is appended to the endpoint object with a ‘/’ inbetween, but is still accessible in Chrome 44 legacy reasons. In Chrome 45, the subscriptionId will be completely removed.  Lastly, Notfication.data and ServiceWorkerRegistration.getNotifications() have been added. These should give developers more control: Sites can now use getNotifications to observe which of their notifications are still being displayed and Notification.data to store a payload with a notification so they can determine which notification was clicked.  All of the above is explained with code examples in this nerdy Google Developers video (if you’re wondering, this is the best part ):   Other developer features in this release include:   Chrome’s implementation of the Push API has undergone several minor breaking changes in order to keep up to date with the evolving specification.  ES6 extended Unicode escape sequences allow developers to use the extended set of Unicode characters in JavaScript string literals, where previously characters whose escape sequences contain more than four hexadecimal values were unable to be denoted.  This release includes a new implementation of multi-column layout by Opera engineer Morten Stenshorne, solving historic issues with incorrect column balancing.  Developers should now use the scroll attributes of 1155cc; font-family: ‘Courier New’; font-size: 13.333333333333332px; font-style: nodocument.scrollingElement instead of document.body as the latter has several well known issues .   Chrome 44 also includes 43 security fixes, of which Google chose to highlight the following:   [$3000][ 446032 ] High CVE-2015-1271: Heap-buffer-overflow in pdfium. Credit to cloudfuzzer.

If you add all those up, you’ll see Google spent at least $39,674 in bug bounties for this release (there are three bounties that still don’t have a price set). The security improvements alone should be enough incentive for you to upgrade to Chrome 44.

"Star Wars: Galaxy Of Heroes Mobile Game Gets Guilds And Raids In New Update

 The ability to blow up a planet is insignificant next to the power of an update.  The mobile role-playing game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes has added guilds and raids in a new batch of content. Galaxy of Heroes is the No. 80 ranked game for iOS, according to App Annie . Updates like this can keep current players engaged (and more likely to spend money) and bring back those who stopped playing. The mobile gaming industry was worth $34.8 billion in 2015, according to market research group Newzoo.  Guilds will enable players to easily form communities and chat with each other. They can create their own logos, set their own officers, and compete with or against each other in special challenges. You have to be level 22 before joining a guild.  Raids are a new set of special encounters. The first one, The Pit, has players fighting a Rancor (the monster under Jabba’s Palace in Return of the Jedi). You can also earn Han Solo as a new character from playing the raid.  This new content comes just a bit before May 4, which many use to celebrate the Star Wars franchise (May the 4th be with you). Fans will be looking for Star Wars-themed content to enjoy on that day, and this update could help drive more of them to Galaxy of Heroes.

"Clear Channel Launches Iheartradio Talk, Letting Everyone From Jimmy Kimmel To Joe Six Pack Be Heard

iHeartRadio is launching into the wide world of talk radio, with iHeartRadio Talk. Along with featuring content (which iHeartRadio calls audiosodes) from top national and local talk personalities such as The Huffington Post, Ryan Seacrest, Univision, and the Wall Street Journal, iHeartRadio will also allow any one in the world to upload their own audiosode through Spreaker. Spreaker is a service that gives anyone, from musicians to producers to radio personalities, the opportunity to be heard, by uploading their audio to the service and broadcasting it to the world. iHeartRadio has developed a partnership with Spreaker to power the audio capture/recording/uploading of users content on to iHeartRadio Talk. “We think of iHeartRadio Talk as a middle ground between WordPress and YouTube,” said Brian Lakamp, head of digital at Clear Channel. “Audio hasn’t really been explored when it comes to user generated content, and we want to be at the forefront of that.” iHeartRadio Talk consists of three main pieces. The first is show pages. Anyone who uploads audiosodes to iHeartRadio talk will automatically get a show page, to which users can subscribe and find out more information about the personality. When users submit audiosodes for consideration, they’re first run through an editorial team to ensure high quality content. While iHeartRadio certainly doesn’t want to censor anyone, it’s a tough line to walk when there are plenty of people who will poop out possibly offensive, or simply worthless, content to the platform. During this beta period, iHeartRadio will work to figure out the best editorial process for allowing audiosodes onto the service. The second piece of the puzzle is the Daily Pulse, which is a customizable channel filled with all the hottest audiosodes for the day. When a user signs in, they’ll automatically be given a pre-set Daily Pulse, which they can then go in and customize to add their friends’ audiosodes, their favorite sports shows, etc. Finally, iHeartRadio Talk offers a new way to advertise for iHeartRadio. “We have a huge opportunity to build out branded content, whether its DIY shows, automotive shows, or shows about fashion and cooking,” said LeKamp. “We can do this in a way that resonates with the brands but still offers high value content.” For the time being, this is a beta launch. Still there are more than 50,000 audiosodes across 20 channels that iHeartRadio fans can tap into. Users can access the beta version of the iHeartRadio Talk service on the web or through iHeartRadio’s iOS or Android apps.

"Aws Launches Container Registry To Simplify Container Management

Amazon announced Amazon EC2 Container Registry , a tool designed to simplify container management for developers today at the Amazon re:invent conference, Last year Amazon announced EC2, its container service, which provides support for Docker images. As Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO told the crowd, as you generate, store and launch these container images, having a registry to keep track of them and reference them becomes increasingly important. “This makes it part of the development process,” Vogels explained. It enables developers to create and test images and place the images into registry when they are ready to launch, he said. As with most Amazon services, the company found that many customers were creating their own registries for this purpose. This put an unnecessary burden on the companies with resources to do that, and put it out of reach for folks who didn’t have the resources to build their own. By delivering the registry as a service, it gives both groups easy access to a tool that is essential to the container management process. As you would expect the container registry is well integrated with the rest of the Amazon container services and the images themselves get stored in Amazon S3, enabling Amazon to sell more storage. As containers grow in increasing popularity with developers, it makes sense that Amazon is trying to develop a full range of services to help meet those needs, and minimize the amount of extra work they have to do to create, manage and run their containers. The new service will be available later this year.

"Roundup: Joost’S Api, Fliqz’S Easy Video Toolbar, Nbc-Itunes Rift, More

 Here’s this morning’s roundup of the latest action:  Joost opens widget API to developers:  Joost , the oft-hyped online video site started by the founders of Skype, has soft-launched an application programming interface this week. It is trying to get third-party developers to build widgets on top of its online TV network so Joost users can do more with the site’s data.  The company already has sample widgets available on its test site , including a “What’s Similar” widget that displays recommendations for video clips similar to the ones you’re already watching. The most exciting aspect of Joost’s API is the access it gives developers to build social tagging and video-programming features into the site. As NewTeeVee notes : It’s a way for users to create sets of videos tailored specifically to their own interests, with minimal effort.  Widgets can do wonders for a site’s growth, but we’re still not sure if they will for Joost. For example, Myspace stood out a couple years ago for allowing outside developers to build widgets that integrated with its social network, giving users the chance to redefine how they used Myspace.  However, Myspace’s flexibility — and hardcore marketing in influential Los Angeles circles — came in tandem with market-leader Friendster’s implosion.  Joost doesn’t appear to have the same advantages. It may have raised a lot of money, with big content deals under its belt, and a solid grounding in how peer-to-peer video-sharing works. But, a lot of other big video sites, like Dailymotion , Veoh and Metacafe, have their own ideas about the future of online video, and they are raising big bucks, too.   Fliqz’s new super-easy toolbar to upload video — Fliqz , the Berkeley start-up, has made it extremely easily to copy a video into your blog. Until now, it has offered an nifty video upload tool, but not as easy as the toolbar. That older product lets you upload video into a player on your Web site sites (the player is called Fliqzster ) and does it without forcing you to download any software. That was simple, but you still had to tab to your hompage to to get the code, and then toggle back to your editor to paste it in your article or Web page. But now the company has released a toolbar, called “Quikvid ,” which lets you upload any video from your desktop or other source straight from your editor (because it reside on the top of your browser). If you’re a blogger writing an entry, you simply raise your eye to your toolbar, browse to select the video from your desktop, then hit “upload” and cut and paste the generated code into the editor. The toolbar is an install on your IE browser. There’s no other product like it on the market, Fliqz’s Kris Drey says.     Viacom hits guy for copyright infringement, but does so for a post he made of content that Viacom itself had taken from him without permission — Read this bizarrely ironic story here .  NBC Universal won’t renew contract with Apple’s iTunes service — NBC Universal says it was unable to come to an agreement with Apple on pricing, and so will no longer sell digital downloads of television shows on iTunes after the current contract runs out in December, according to the New York Times . NBC was the largest supplier of digital video to Apple, accounting for 40 percent of video downloads, including hits such as “Battlestar Galactica,” “The Office” and “Heroes.” This is a big deal, because its the latest evidence studios are bugged by  Apple’s power and are trying to break free. It comes after NBC has made progress recently in creating its own joint venture, now called Hulu , to compete with iTunes and YouTube. In July, the Universal Music Group of Vivendi, the world’s biggest music corporation, said it would not renew its long-term contract with iTunes.

"Atheros Envisions An “Internet Of Things” Connected By Home Power Lines

 One of these days, there will be an “internet of things” — once-dumb appliances and gadgets smartened up with chips and internet connectivity. Wireless chip maker Atheros Communications believes that day is not so far away.  Today, the San Jose maker of wireless chips is announcing an initiative that will make it easy for internet-aware home appliances to transfer data over electrical wires in the home to a user’s web-connected devices and to the smart grid. This initiative is one of the enabling steps to putting smart appliances on the grid without spending money to wire them with traditional Ethernet-based wiring.  “There will be 100 internet-connected devices per home one day,” said Adam Lapede, senior director of internet of things technology at Atheros, in an interview.  It’s kind of a pipe dream, but it’s a big one that is shared by a lot of companies that want to make everyday appliances smarter, more useful in providing data feedback, and more energy efficient. Atheros has chosen to connect the smart appliances using the HomePlug Green Phy, or a version of the HomePlug AV standard for transferring internet data over home electrical wires.  Atheros, which is in the process of being acquired by Qualcomm, designed the technology so that smart appliances can transfer or receive internet data without consuming a lot of power or taking much of the available internet bandwidth of the home wires, Lapede said. Once connected, these devices will be readable, recognizable, locatable, and addressable. It means they will be able to provide information such as how much energy they are consuming and what times are best to use them preserving energy.  “We need to figure out how to reduce the demand during peak usage and improve our efficiency,” Lapede said.  Lapede said the cost of internet connectivity is getting smaller and smaller. Atheros, which makes Wi-Fi chips and other related technology, hopes to drive the costs of the connectivity chips even lower by making them in huge quantities and standardizing them across the industry  With the HomePlug Green Phy technology, Atheros is asking software developers to begin building applications that will use its chip hardware for the “internet of things” vision that would integrate the technology into stand-alone gateway devices or into the appliances themselves. It will allow the transfer of data from device to device at a rate of 10 megabits a second or more. That will happen seamlessly, without the need to translate the data from one format to another.  Lapede said that applications will have to use built-in encryption and other security methods to ensure that one neighbor won’t be able to hack another across the smart grid. Lapede said the power line technology has rivals, but he believes it is the best way to reach all of the appliances in the home. And while HomePlug AV has a number of rivals, he says chips based on the standard have shipped in the tens of millions of units worldwide. So it makes sense to adapt HomePlug for the internet of things.  Once the applications have been defined and requirements set, Atheros will design chips based on the standard and ship them to customers in the coming years.  “We expect to see traction in 2012,” Lapede said.

"Sgn Aims For Cross-Platform Social Gaming Domination

 Last year, SGN made a bet that social gaming would transcend any one platform , and it aggressively expanded from its core group of gaming applications on Facebook to building games for the iPhone. Even though many rivals have gotten bigger than SGN on Facebook, it has surpassed them on the iPhone while maintaining key games on Facebook. Now, it looks set to take advantage of its cross-platform reach.  The first of SGN’s bets paid off in March, when Facebook launched its Connect service for the iPhone . The service lets you play iPhone games against your Facebook friends, creating experiences you couldn’t just have with either the device or the phone on their own. For example, in SGN’s Agency Wars role-playing spy game for the iPhone, you can first invite your friends on Facebook to play using Connect. Then, once they start playing, you can use the iPhone to do things like set a location-based virtual bomb to blow up their character when they walk by with their iPhone.  Overall, SGN has more than 12 million of its games installed on iPhones and iPod Touches — its on an average of one in three of these devices — and a 25 percent user crossover with Facebook. It only has around 2.4 million monthly active Facebook users for its 25 Facebook applications, according to AppData, distantly trailing rival Zynga’s 41.5 million .  But, the second part of SGN’s bet  will begin paying off this summer , when Apple enables microtransactions on the iPhone . Virtual currencies and virtual goods have already proven popular with users on Facebook — and some companies that build applications for it and other social networks are making millions. Industry insiders have estimated to us that developers could make up to half a billion dollars in revenue this year on Facebook alone, mostly from virtual goods. As a stand-alone platform, this will be valuable for many games.  You can see how this will make a difference for companies like SGN. On Facebook, its Tamagotchi -style (fluff)friends application is already making millions of dollars through its 520,000 monthly active users buying things like virtual clothes to decorate their virtual pets with. Users can also virtually pet their friends (fluff)friends, or race the pets against each other. The revenue adds up in this game. A special subscription service gives people extra points, and free physical stuffed toy pets. The application has tens of thousands of these subscribers, and averages above $500 in revenue for each one, chief executive Shervin Pishevar tells me. SGN was one of the early companies experimenting with the virtual goods model on Facebook — and, while I haven’t figured out how much the company is making from that revenue stream or others, I have heard it is profitable.   SGN has been planning for iPhone virtual goods, by continuing to blur the lines not just between platforms but between games that span platforms. On Monday, for example, it is introducing a special (fluff)friend pet, Agent Yawobbly (pictured, top), that you can win by reaching a high enough level in Agency Wars. Sure, there may not be a lot crossover in users between (fluff)friends’ mostly older, female user base and Agency Wars certainly younger crowd. But for the people busy taking care of their (fluff)friends while using their iPhones to blow up their Facebook friends, Agent Yawobbly is going to seem like a special touch.  Of course, expect more linear integration between (fluff)friends and SGN’s iPhone app of the same theme, iFluff Pets — like being able to take care of your Facebook pet from your phone, and race your pet against your friends pet. And expect to see the combination of social and mobile and more and more SGN applications. Other games, like its forthcoming group Jet Fighter game, will enable much of the same. In that title, friends will be able to form squadrons and battle other squadrons in real-time from across Facebook and the iPhone.  To be sure, many other companies have been busy experimenting with the cross-over between social networks and mobile devices. Rivals like Zynga and Playfish passed SGN long ago on Facebook, but haven’t gotten nearly as big on the iPhone. Facebook Connect and competing services like MySpaceID are going to make it easier for social networking developers to introduce social features, and tie in those mobile games to their existing user bases. SGN’s early reach across both types of platforms, however, could give it an edge in further promoting its games everywhere. Indeed, my game-obsessed colleague, Dean Takahashi, has recently predicted the emergence of a cross-platform social games empire — SGN could be it.

"Volt & Google To Help You Remember Where You Parked

Feeling a bit forgetful? Worried that you’re not going to be able to find your way back to your car? Worry no longer, there’s now an Android app for that. All you need is an Android phone, and Chevy Volt with OnStar. Once you’re parked, you can speak your destination into your phone which will then keep track of where you are relative to that point, and help you to find your way back. This is actually just part of GM’s plan for the Volt, which is going to be closely linked with the Google platform when it comes out. In addition to the location feature, you’ll also be able to check the battery level, monitor the vehicles overall health, and even run the A/C before you get in. [via DVice ]

"Microsoft Updates Windows App Studio With Templates, Support For Wordpress And Ads

 Microsoft today announced several updates to its free Windows App Studio Beta web service for building Windows apps. Now there are new templates you can use to get started, tools for dropping ads into apps, and new ways to display content in apps.  Microsoft first launched the tool in 2013, under the name Windows Phone App Studio Beta. In April 2014 Microsoft relaunched the tool and changed the name to Windows App Studio Beta. Since then Microsoft has rolled out updates here and there, including TouchDevelop programming language support and support for the Windows 10 Insider Preview . Today there are several changes for users to check out.  Of course, people can use other services if they want to build apps, but Windows App Studio is a point-and-click experience, which opens it up for non-technical users. Last year the service boasted 2.3 million users.  A few users have asked for the ability to place ads inside apps they create with Windows App Studio, according to the service’s UserVoice page, and now it’s possible.  “It’s great to have people using and enjoying your app, but it’s even better when those eyeballs translate into revenue!” as the Windows App Studio team put it in a blog post today on the latest updates.  You can now connect a WordPress blog to Windows App Studio, and one of the three new templates Microsoft is introducing is specifically dedicated to WordPress blogs. Here’s an example of an app built with the template:  Above: An example of the WordPress template in Microsoft’s Windows App Studio. Image Credit: Microsoft  The other two templates are My Shop, for implementing an ecommerce experience or just showing many visual designs, and Events, for providing information to people attending events, with room for speaker biographies.  If you’d like, you can throw in content from other pages with the new Related Content feature. New templates for this component are on the way, the Windows App Studio team wrote.  And there are also new ways to display images. You can turn on the new Carousel, which switch out multiple hero images like a slideshow. Plus, “you can change the background and adjust the hero image for each section individually and choose how each section appears on the default/home section of your app,” the Windows App Studio team wrote.  You can access Windows App Studio here .

"At&T Cto: ‘We Will Move Heaven And Earth’ To Improve Our Network

 AT&T Chief Technology Officer John Donovan described his vision for a future where more and more data is flowing through mobile networks. He made the comments at VentureBeat’s MobileBeat 2010 conference today in San Francisco.  The issue can be a sensitive one for AT&T, whose network quality, especially in iPhone-heavy urban areas, has been heavily criticized. So when VentureBeat Editor in Chief Matt Marshall got a chance to ask Donovan a few questions on-stage, he asked what kinds of issues are holding back network quality. It’s a little bit of everything, Donovan replied. With a flood of new chipsets, phones, and applications, the traditional device testing and rollout methods have “broken down.” In addition, AT&T recently faced a shortage of the components needed to improve its network.  “I’ll tell you the things it’s not been,” Donovan said. “It’s not been capital, it’s not been conviction and commitment.” AT&T “will move heaven and Earth” to meet its customers’ growing data needs, he said.  And those data needs will keep increasing over time. We’re only at the beginning of the growth curve, he said. Donovan broke down mobile data usage into three phases — we’re still in phase one, which is the “traditional data world,” and we will soon enter phase two, which Donovan described as “application readiness,” followed by phase three in 2014. By that point, Donovan predicted, we will see point-to-point video, and the amount of data usage in 2008 will basically round down to zero in comparison, he said.  Matt also asked whether the United States will continue to lag behind other countries like Japan when it comes to mobile technology. Donovan replied that he’s “tired” of that question, arguing that the United States has “been a clear leader in phones, designs, operating systems, and applications” in the last three years, and that has only accelerated in the last 24 months.  As for how AT&T’s business evolves in that landscape, Donovan said, “Our world gets very complex very fast.” The market is becoming more competitive, but it’s also presenting new opportunities for mobile carriers. “We’re going to have our own experiences,” he said. “Some of those are going to be in the foreground and some of them are going to be in the background.”  [ photo: JP Manninen ]

"Foodzie Raises $1M For Foodie Treats

 Foodzie , an online marketplace for specialty-food producers and growers, has just raised $1 million in seed funding. The company is part of this year’s group of startups incubated by TechStars .  Foodzie launches with 25 small food artisans and growers on its site. It’s much easier for foodies to discover new products on a single site than through the artisans’ standalone web sites (think about how many bands link to their MySpace music pages). With an emphasis on handmade and locally-grown products from across the country, you can’t just pick up Foodzie’s offerings at your nearest Whole Foods or specialty-foods store. Hand-dipped chocolate-covered graham crackers and California cheese made from fresh raw milk are just a few of the treats available.  It’s easy for producers to set up an online store through Foodzie, and establish their personalities through their company and product descriptions, Foodzie says. Consumers have a direct way of contacting the individual producers as well, through e-mail. You can also recommend new products for Foodzie to carry here .  The site connects buyers directly to the producers, unlike Amazon or iGourmet. This way, the producers manage their inventory and all of the shipping while Foodzie handles the transactions. When we last spoke to Foodzie, their revenue model involved a small $0.60 cent transaction fee and about 20 percent commission on all sales. Hopefully, the producers can keep up as demand grows for their creations and the site expands with more vendors. Organic, gluten-free, vegan and nut-free products appear to be among the most sought after items on Foodzie.  The seed funding comes from from Jeff Clavier at SoftTechVC, First Round Capital and undisclosed angel investors.

"Cloud Management Startup Rightscale Raises Another $13M

 It looks like the economic downturn hasn’t eliminated investment for cloud computing. RightScale , a Santa Barbara, Calif. company that manages applications in the Internet cloud , has raised $13 million in a second round of funding.  There are other app management companies out there, such as WeoCeo and Intridea , but chief executive Michael Crandell has said RightScale stands out with its visual interface and the monitoring it provides with its own servers. Initially, RightScale (like most of the competition), focused on managing applications running on Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud, but in the last few months it has announced support for apps in GoGrid, FlexiScale and RackSpace too.  Crandell didn’t share many specifics, but says RightScale has been growing every month, and he doesn’t see that slowing anytime soon. In this economic climate, more companies are looking for an easy and affordable way to run their applications in the cloud, rather than on their own servers.  “We’re seeing increasing interest among large companies, who say, ‘If we can avoid buying another Blade server, I want to,'” Crandell says  He adds that RightScale isn’t running out of cash (good to know, since it raised $4.5 million back in April ) and just took the investment to fuel growth. Plus, raising money could be even harder next year. It also helped that lead backer Index Ventures is based in Europe, where RightScale gets one-fourth of its customers, so this could provide a good launch pad for international expansion.  RightScale’s first round investor, Benchmark Capital , participated in the new round. New Relic, a Benchmark startup that manages applications built in the Ruby on Rails programming framework , also announced a second round last month.

"Biotech Financing: Are Early-Stage Companies Hot Again?

 Venture investors’ interest in early-stage biotech companies may finally be starting to revive, nearly six years after the collapse of a biotech-stock bubble quashed appetites for the industry’s riskiest but often most innovative companies.  Biotech fundraising is certainly booming. The industry newsletter BioCentury (no link available) recently reported that biotechnology pulled in nearly $2 billion in venture capital during the first quarter, topping the previous record of more than $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2000. A recent survey by law firm Fenwick & West* revealed that 79 percent of Bay Area biotechs saw their valuations rise during 2006, compared to 65 percent in 2005. Those rising valuations follow years in which the dreaded “down round” — a funding event that lowers the dollar value of a company — had become commonplace.  The bigger question, however, has been whether VCs would also renew their interest in early-stage biotechs — companies so young it could them a decade or more to push a new drug or related product through development and the regulatory approval process. Once making up the bulk of biotechnology in the first place, early-stage companies fell out of of favor after the 2000 biotech-stock bubble collapsed. Battered VCs shifted their attention to more mature companies that offered quicker “exits” — that is, profits on the venture investments — via initial offerings or acquisitions. Some in the industry worried that innovative but risky drug development and technologies might languish as a result.  Although it’s still early, venture funding for early-stage companies may be starting to pick up. Last month, for instance, a genetics and molecular-imaging startup called Numira Bioscience raised $2.5 million in first-round funding, $2 million of that from vSpring Capital . A few days later, Affinium Pharmaceuticals, a proteomics company-turned-antibiotic developer, raised $18 million as part of its restructuring and drew in Forward Ventures as a new investor.  Since enthusiasm for biotech tends to wax and wane periodically, VCs such as Phillipe Chambon of New Leaf Venture Partners say the resurgence of interest in early-stage companies reflects “the pendulum swinging back in the opposite direction.” One main reason: Cash-rich Big Pharma companies are desperate to bolster their own drug-development efforts by acquiring biotechs. (Even established biotechs like MedImmune are feeling the pressure to put themselves up for sale .) Since the pharmas are increasingly willing to buy even less mature biotechs, venture capitalists see early exits growing more likely, which in turn makes them more comfortable about funding the industry’s youngest companies.  At least, so goes the theory.  (* Disclosure: Fenwick & West is a sponsor of VentureBeat )

"Android'S ""Blapkmarket"" Pirated App Repository Goes Down Hard

Now, before we enter the breach, I think it bears repeating that MobileCrunch and indeed the rest of the TechCrunch network in no way condone software/application piracy . Developers work too hard for responsible members of the tech community to give them the shaft like that. That said, while cracked iPhone app repositories like apptrackr continue to operate with impunity, we’re surprised to see that the big Android equivalent has been forced to shut down first. Jesusxxx’s Blapkmarket, which provided paid apps free of charge to its users, was just recently shut down by his hosting company. The justifications for maintaining a collection of pirated apps are many, and they generally seem to address legitimate grievances with the whole app purchase process. Blapkmarket, for example, allowed users to “test” applications outside of the standard 24 hour grace period laid out in the Android Market program policies . Perhaps more importantly, it allowed Android users in other countries to access and use apps that for one reason or another weren’t available in their home markets. Jesusxxx has even gone on record saying that foreign customers “ provide[d] the highest number of requests for paid apps ” in an interview with Android Guys . As noble as those intentions may be, there’s no question that each app pirated robbed developers of sweet, sweet revenue. For all the “scrupulous” users that made avail of the service for legitimate reasons (which doesn’t necessarily excuse their actions), there were undoubtedly countless others that just couldn’t be bothered to pay for anything. With Blapkmarket out of picture for now, the big question is whether other shutdowns are on the horizon. Bigger targets are certainly out there, with repos like apptrackr being prime among them. Whether Blapkmarket’s death knell spells doom for more pirated app repositories is unclear, but one thing seems clear: like their big media brethren, app developers are starting to take pirating very seriously.

"Sap Gives Startups Millions Of Dollars Worth Of Software. Here’S Why.

  Spend any time at SAP ‘s headquarters in Silicon Valley and you’ll hear the name “HANA” spoken in hushed and reverential tones by flip-flop wearing engineers and buttoned-up executives alike. HANA is fast, expensive, and touted as one of the most exciting developments in years.  “HANA” (which stands for High-Performance Analytic Appliance) is a container that can store up to 500 terabytes of data, and execute at high speed.  SAP’s executives will tell you that HANA is the software behemoth’s answer to the “big data” trend, and last quarter it generated $106 million in revenue, putting SAP on track to meet full-year expectations of at least $400 million.  “Innovation in data management has stagnated,” said Amit Sinha, the head of database and technology product marketing for SAP. Sinha said that he foresees a $2 trillion market opportunity for HANA and related database management technologies in the SAP suite.  As you would expect from SAP, which counts Oracle as its major competitor, HANA’s customers are brand-name companies with million dollar IT budgets, such as Deloitte, Adobe, Cisco Systems, and consumer-products giant Proctor & Gamble.  SAP should have been able to play the game it always does: selling its database technology to customers with mammoth IT budgets. But reports increasingly show that HANA has not met industry expectations. As Irregular Enterprise writer Dennis Howlett inferred in a recent column :  “Once early adopters got over the speed shock, they quickly settled into ‘so what?’ mode. SAP is now at an inflection point where it has to figure out what to do with HANA beyond speeds and feeds.”  That time is now. SAP may have hit on the real use for HANA.  The SAP Startup Program  HANA’s customers also include Taulia and Zettaset . Haven’t heard of them? They are fast-growing enterprise IT startups, and they are among the dozen handpicked by SAP to develop their applications on HANA for free.  It’s has been about a year since the SAP Startup Focus program launched, and it has recently extended its network to Ireland and India. Here’s how the program works: SAP selects early-stage enterprise and IT companies that are applying predictive analytics to a specific problem or vertical, like supply chain management or retail inventory. They receive HANA, advice, and mentorship from SAP executives. Graduates of SAP’s startup program include Host Analytics , Retailigence , FusionOps (an SAP partner), Optessa , and iSky .  With this effort, SAP is following in Microsoft’s footsteps. Microsoft’s BizSpark program provides startups with free software tools in an effort to build loyalty early in a companies’ life cycle. Robin Meyerhoff, an SAP spokesperson, said that the company’s strategy is similar and involves “spurring SAP HANA adoption much like most other platform companies do.”  But SAP isn’t offering the gift of Outlook or Powerpoint: It’s giving away software that’s worth millions of dollars.  So what’s in it for SAP?  At a recent SAP innovation conference, Jason Yotopolous, the executive vice president of global research and business incubation at SAP, hinted at the company’s reasoning. “We are building startups within SAP,” he said, and he added that they work in a “co-innovation fashion” with these companies.  “Innovation is a challenge within a big company,” he admitted.  Next to take the stage were partners from SAP Ventures, the venture arm (with SAP as its sole LP) that has poured funds into portfolio companies across the enterprise landscape. Notable investments include cloud storage provider Box ; Endeca , an enterprise search vendor acquired by Oracle; and flash storage company Violin Memory .  It should come as no surprise that SAP Ventures recently announced that it would set aside $155 million to fund startups initiated into the program.  “SAP is betting big on big data,” said Sinha in an interview with VentureBeat. “We are always looking for startups invest in and potentially to acquire.”  I spoke with SAP Ventures’ new COO and managing director, Elizabeth Clarkson, who said that the venture firm is autonomous and independent, but admitted that they are “always trying to figure out which ones [from the program] we might fund.”  Is it all starting to come together?  If SAP isn’t going to produce the innovations of the decade in-house, it sure better get behind the startups that are.  It’s not just about building loyalty with early-stage companies before they grow and are flooded with options such as IBM and Oracle. It’s about ensuring SAP has an equity stake and, when the timing is right, that it can make the first stab at acquisition.  As co-CEO Jim Hagemann Snabe hinted in a recent interview with Germany newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, an aggressive acquisition strategy is part of SAP’s DNA. “”Our long-term growth should be made up of two-thirds by organic strength and one-third by acquisitions,” he said.  The SAP acquisition trail has showed no signs of coming to a halt: the company picked up SuccessFactors for $3.4 billion, and it purchased Ariba, a business software management company, for $4.3 billion.  Joe Hyland, the marketing lead for Taulia, a startup that uses HANA to learn new ways companies can save money in the supply chain process, explains: “Giving startups HANA for free is a wise investment.” Taulia, a San Francisco-based company founded in 2009, was selected for the current batch of startups to receive free software. It is now partnered with SAP.  The relationship is a two-way street; many of these startups will also receive access to SAP’s network of household-name customers. It can be a major stumbling block for early-stage enterprise companies to gain traction. Typically, they have to adopt a “fake it till you make it” approach. Like Taulia, many of these startups now consider themselves “SAP partners” and reap the benefits.  SAP has hit on another compelling use for HANA. This summer, it announced that the startup program has been such a success that it will begin offering developers free access to HANA and make it available on Amazon Web Services. (Note: You will still have to pay for AWS usage.)  Meyerhoff, a member of the communications team for SAP, told me that the end goal is to “launch a revenue share model for productive use,” meaning that SAP will take a cut once the company launches a product.  “We do not buy market share. We buy the future.”  HANA is a database tool that is a bit faster than most, but is expensive to access and deploy. Through smart tactics, it gave SAP an opportunity to get its foot in the door with developers that are building the next wave of technologies for the enterprise.  It became clear during my time at SAP that the strategy was railroaded from above by the highest echelons of the company: the board.  “Four years ago, people were suspending belief,” Yotopolous explained. “Now, we are driving some compelling revenue, we’ve been recognized by the board of directors, and are starting to scale that up. The sky is the limit”  According to SAP, acquisitions are the only way to innovate and make progress in new areas of business. The startup program is a brilliant move, and ensures that SAP is firmly in the running to snap up the most promising startups when the timing is right. “We do not buy market share”, said Snabe in an interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung . “We buy the future.”

"Android Market Now Has 1 Billion App Downloads Per Month

 Google’s Android Market has exceeded 10 billion application downloads, with users now downloading at a rate of one billion apps per month, the company announced Tuesday.  The download growth rate is rather incredible. Android Market experienced its first billion downloads in July 2010, and reached three billion downloads by March of this year. By July 2011, Android Market had surpassed six billion downloads.  By comparison, Apple reported more than 18 billion app downloads in October. The Android Market is hot on its heels, and we’re not surprised. Android now commands half of the U.S. smartphone platform market .  And you should expect the Android Market download figure to shoot up exponentially — and soon. App downloads are already rising at an accelerating pace, and there will likely be a flurry of post-holiday download activity as gift recipients fire up their brand new Android-powered tablets and mobile devices, and load them up with apps.  Android Market does, however, face app download competition from a growing number of third-party Android app stores, including Amazon’s own Appstore for Android.  Google is currently offering Android Market customers top Android apps at $0.10 a piece for the next 10 days to celebrate this achievement.

"Favstar.Fm Makes The Twitter ""Favorite"" Less Of An Unwanted Step-Child

The “Favorite” is kind of like the unwanted step child feature of Twitter. Though it has been around since the early days of the service, they have never really done anything to promote its use. One would assume you’re supposed to use it to start your favorite tweets, but I don’t use it like that, because what’s the point? Instead, I mostly use it to bookmark tweets that I want to find later. But a new service Favstar.fm hopes to take the Favorite functionality back to its roots, and make it useful. While the fairly popular Favrd service has revolved around favorites for a while, it is basically only useful to show the most favorited tweets across the whole network on any given day. You can find individual user pages, but it’s not very obvious how to do that, and results only go back for a few weeks. Favstar.fm wants to be the all encompassing Twitter favorites destination. The main page shows a recent leaderboard that can be set to show tweets of only a certain level (10 favorites, for example). If you sign in via Twitter OAuth, you get a whole range of functionality, including the ability to follow people from Favstar.fm and see what tweets your friends are favoriting. Also, by signing in it is easy to see who is favoriting your tweets. As we all know, a big part of Twitter is vanity, so many of us likely want to know who is favoriting which tweets of ours. With Favstar.fm, it’s easy to see that. Because it’s aiming to track favorites across the whole network for all time periods, Favstar works a little slower than Favrd does, developer Tim Haines tells us. But it seems like a fair trade-off to get all this data. And if you want your data quicker, Favstar.fm prioritizes those users who sign in via Twitter OAuth.

"Obituary Site 1000Memories Not Dying For Cash, With $2.5M From Greylock Partners

 1000memories , an online crowd-sourced obituary service, announced that it has raised $2.5 million in its first round of funding from Greylock Partners.  It’s an online site that creates individual landing pages for people who have died. Anyone can jump to a page and write a few words or post a picture or song. The result is a collage of photos, music and thoughts that’s supposed to capture the essence of an obituary. The site is also working on ways to share memories from the site by creating widgets and other types of sharable content, he said.  The site is free for the time being and there aren’t any near-term plans to monetize the content, Adler said. 1000memories might look into creating personalized websites and having ways to output the content on the site — say, through a “book of memories” — as a way to monetize the site, he said.  “Right now we don’t limit for how people can use it because we’re so interested in seeing how we use it,” said site co-founder Rudy Adler. “People use it to make memorials for pets, and a lot of other unexpected things — we’re in the stage of having a conversation with our users.”  The funding is a pretty big vote of confidence from Greylock Partners, which was a natural fit for the site because of the firm’s storied history with social networking sites, Adler said. The venture firm has invested in the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn.  1000memories seems like a huge emotional investment for a lot of people. Most crowd-sourced sites run into the problem of ruffians and trolls infiltrating the community and trying to disrupt — such as at sites like news aggregator Digg and online message board 4chan. 1000memories seems to have avoided that problem thus far from inspection — most of the publicly available sites seem genuine enough.  “We got a lot of spammers at first, but that seems to have scaled back,” he said. “There have been very few disruptions.”  1000memories participated in the summer 2010 class of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley incubator, and has raised $3 million in funding to date. Greylock Partners’ David Thacker will join 1000memories’ board as part of the funding deal. A number of angel investors including Keith Rabois, Ron Conway and Chris Sacca also participated in this recent funding round.

"Reddit Rumored To Be Raising Money, At A $400 Million Valuation

Welcome to yet another Rumor Sunday™ . In 2011, Reddit was spun out of Conde Nast as a standalone company, but the publishing giant kept full ownership. At the time, Peter Kafka of AllthingsD reported that Conde Nast had considered the option of selling off parts of the company to investors at a $200 million valuation. That idea was scrapped at the time because they didn’t think Reddit needed the money. But we’re hearing now from a source that, a little over a year later, Reddit is raising money. And the company’s valuation has jumped to $400 million. Earlier this year, Reddit brought on a new CEO , Yishan Wong, to take control. A former director of engineering at Facebook, Wong reiterated at the time that Reddit has established a new board (which includes co-founder Alexis Ohanian) and was revamping its capital structure to allow the company “to manage its own finances and operations, including the ability to provide competitive equity compensation to its employees, which [it hasn’t] been able to do in the past.” At the time, Wong said the company wanted to gain further flexibility and get full control over its resources. A raise now could be an interesting move for Reddit. And outside investors may be champing at the bit to get a piece of the company. Last year, the site saw 37 billion page views, 400 million unique visitors, and 30 million posts. In October alone, Reddit saw over 3.8 billion page views and more than 46 million unique visitors, which is double the number of page views from last year. Press from events like President Obama’s “Ask Me Anything” as well as scandals like the violentacrez doxxing have upped awareness of Reddit, as Josh Constine wrote a few weeks ago. Sales have been mainly coming from advertising, and perhaps more recently, subscriptions. Outside investors and an influx of money could also help Reddit continue to grow and to pay for servers and others costs. We’ll update this post if we hear more about the rumors.

"Analytics Company Nuconomy Raises $3M To Bury The Page View

 The page view is dead, declares web analytics company NuConomy , which has raised $3 million to continue digging the grave.  There are plenty of other web analytics companies on the market, but NuConomy’s features can see the furthest beyond the page view and illuminate how users are actually interacting with your site, says chief executive Shahar Nechmad. For one thing, NuConomy is one of the few analytics products that gives you information about individual users — what brought them to your site, and what they do once there — and then to use that data to draw conclusions about, say, the amount of money a certain link or ad is bringing in. NuConomy’s two-way API, however, is what draws the buzz. Rather than just receiving a report, site owners can decide on the fly what information they want, be it the relationship between the number of videos and of visitors, or between comments and purchases (see screenshot above). With just a few clicks, you can select different metrics andNuConomy will bring up a graph showing whether there’s any correlation. For example, Nechmad says, NuConomy could show you that a link from a specific site seems to be bringing in the most paying customers, even if it’s bringing in fewer users overall..  “Normally, you see a report, it’s nice and that’s it,” Nechmad says. “We allow you to decide what kind of contribution is important to you.”  NuConomy (now in private testing mode) offers its analysis for free. Eventually, the company will start charging some of its biggest customers a small fee.Nechmad says he also wants to work with sites to figure out the best advertising solutions — for a cut of the increased revenue.  Above the monetary considerations, Nechmad says he’s just excited to get NuConomy’s analysis into the hands of as many site owners as possible.  “It sounds cliched … but we don’t want to have only customers that can pay $1 million per year,” Nechmad says. “We want to change the web.”  NuConomy is part of a larger wave of businesses that are trying to develop new models of measuring online user engagement. For example, when the TelAviv-based company toured Silicon Valley as part of this year’s Israel Web Tour , it was joined by ClickTale , another company offering detailed information about what users are doing. But where NuConomy emphasizes the a range of relationships between your site and user behavior, ClickTale focuses on providing you a detailed account of exactly what each user does during their visit.  The recent venture round — NuConomy’s first — was led by large advertising conglomerate WPP . NuConomy previously raised $300,000 in seed funding. It’s also opening an office in San Francisco.

"Japan’S Cocon Buys Security Risk Diagnosis Startup Ierae Security

 Tokyo-based internet company Cocon , previously known as Panda Graphics, announced this week the acquisition of Ierae Security , a Japanese internet security diagnosis startup. Although the company has not yet disclosed the transaction value, Ierae Security became a wholly-owned Cocon subsidiary upon Cocon buying up the company’s total outstanding shares.  Ierae Security was founded in 2011 by Makoto Makita, a security engineer, who started up a security diagnosis team at SoftBank and CyberAgent . The company’s competitive edge is vulnerability assessment for web/smartphone apps and IoT (Internet of Things) among others, and they offer security consulting to security system vendors and leading companies in Japan. Their clients include Cybertrust Japan , Sammy Networks , CyberAgent and S&P (not Standard & Poor’s but a Japanese mobile gaming developer), in addition to Photosynth , which is behind smart lock solution Akerun as well as other firms.  See also: Japan’s Akerun smart lock to start shipping soon, expecting to reach 10,000 orders in a year  Meanwhile, as indicated by the company’s former name, Cocon is derived from Panda Graphics , an illustration-focused crowdsourcing platform. The company, established in February of 2013, secured 140 million yen from East Ventures and Opt in July of 2014 while also raising undisclosed-amount funds from China’s SIG Asia Investments and this company’s closely-related Japanese firm, MS Capital . After entering into a capital tie-up with Tokyo-based 3DCG production Mox Mortion in June of 2014, and with UI/UX design agency Ohako in January of 2015, they purchased  crowdsourcing platform Voip covering the voice-acting sector in May of 2015. Thus, they are active for tie-ups and acquisitions involving startups.  Ierae Security moved their headquarters to Cocon’s office in September 2015; therefore we can presume the process of this acquisition is based on their continued and close cooperative relationship.  When asked about the business synergies between two companies upon this acquisition, Yuya Kuratomi, CEO at Cocon, explained that the company is dealing with many game developers, and the demand for security solutions against cheating and such has increased. They aim to offer mobile app security solution and also expect mutual introductions among their clients.  This business expansion method, in which startups invest in or acquire another startups, has been recently seen in the case of Japan’s c2c (consumer to consumer) marketplace app Mercari or our neighbor South Korea’s Yello Mobile . How will Cocon develop their business? This is going to be very interesting.  Translated by Minako Ambiru via Mother First , edited by “Tex” Pomeroy

"Nintendo Details Pikmin 3’S Plot, Characters, And Control Schemes

  One of Nintendo’s “launch-window games” for the Wii U is slowly approaching its actual release date, and the publisher is dropping some details to build up the hype.  On Aug. 4, you can finally get the action-strategy title Pikmin 3. The sequel takes players back to the planet of the tiny plant creatures for an entirely new adventure. As part of its Nintendo Direct today, the company revealed the new cast of heroes that replace the original game’s Captain Olimar. This time, players control a boy named Alph, a scientist named Brittany, and a captain named Charlie.  These three explorers are from Koppai, a planet suffering from worldwide starvation. Charlie and his crew must find fruit on the Pikmin planet and return the seeds to their home. Thankfully, the Pikmin are willing to help them, which the explorers need their help since the fruit is gigantic.  Check out Nintendo president Satoru Iwata talk at length about the title:   Outside of the plot, Nintendo also revealed some information about how Pikmin 3 works compared to previous entries in the franchise. The three characters means players can divide into three teams. This should help skillful players quickly tackle complex objectives.  Pikmin 3 is also a little easier for newcomers because it is introducing an option to replay an area rather than forcing gamers who screw up to replay the whole level.  Finally, the company also revealed the multiple control schemes available in Pikmin 3. The GamePad is the most capable option. Players can obviously direct their characters and Pikmin using the device, but it also provides information about the map, the characters, and the Pikmin. If that’s not your jam, Nintendo is also providing support for the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk combo. The game also works in off-TV mode on the GamePad for players that can use their TV.

"Verizon, Conversa, Greenfield, And Alliance For Connected Care Take On The Patient Journey At Healthbeat

 Patients will soon expect their doctors to be able to access their entire medical history and to experience a seamless journey from healthy to worried to sick to treated to cured – and across home, hospitals, clinics, and insurance paperwork.  In America, the desire for this kind of integration is strong, and stakeholders in the U.S. are setting the stage to get there.  It’s actually achievable. The confluence of electronic health records, accurate recording of invaluable clinical data, and patient-generated data from health wearables can give providers a holistic view of their patients. It’s a view that can inform better decision making, no matter where a provider enters on the continuum of care.  Leading experts at this year’s HealthBeat tackle this very issue, including the heavy-hitters below.  In the session, “Powering the patient journey — Fundamental fixes at scale,” Dr. Peter Tippett, chief medical officer of Verizon Healthcare, and Krista Drobac, executive director of Alliance for Connected Care, look at how integration across the patient journey is achievable.  And in the session, “Do you know how all the patients in your practice are doing between visits?” Dr. Phillip Marshall, chief product officer of Conversa Health, and Dr. Cynthia Ferrier of GreenField Health, look at how data and a two-way exchange of information will provide a holistic view of the patient journey.  Join us for these and other amazing HealthBeat sessions, October 27-28, 2014, exploring this year’s theme, “The patient journey: connections, data, and innovation.”  Check out the full agenda and register here to save your spot.

"Rdio Hops On The Radio Bandwagon With Pandora-Style Stations Based On Your Friends

Mainstream music fans don’t want to constantly choose what to listen to, so streaming services are embracing radio. The latest is Rdio , whose new Friend FM turns your friends’ listening activity and social connections i nto non-stop streams. It’s also added a traditional Pandora-style You FM station thanks to data from The Echo Nest. Together they could let you productively leave Rdio on in the background. While Pandora popularized adaptive online radio, it’s becoming an essential feature for all music services. Spotify added radio at the end of 2011, and Apple is gearing up to launch iTunes Radio alongside iOS 7 this fall. The fact is that people listen to music in different ways. Sometimes you want to hear that one particular song or album, sometimes you want to dabble and discover something new, and sometimes you want to just fire-and-forget a radio station while you work. The more use cases a music service can cover, the more likely people will stick with it, endure ads, or pay for a subscription. Usually, adaptive radio stations build themselves off of your listening habits. That includes what you played, thumbs up or downed, and saved. This is how Rdio’s new You FM works, though it also factors in your Facebook Likes and Twitter Follows. Rdio’s overhaul of Stations also lets your tune into any of yours friends’ You FM stations. Friend FM could get you out of your comfort zone and stumbling upon new artists you can then cue up on-demand. Maria FM could score me some new yoga music, while Alex FM would rock my bones with the latest new metal. Rdio says “It’s like flipping on the car radio and knowing every DJ.” The cross-platform streaming service has also built a more immersive player for Stations, a better navigation system, Stations for genres, and an Auto-Play radio based on the last song or artist you were last listening to. Rdio has some catching up to do. It doesn’t reveal its user counts but some peg it as much, much tinier than direct competitor Spotify which has 24 million active users, over 6 million paying subscribers, and brought in $533 million in revenue in 2012. While many say Rdio’s design is better, its marketing hasn’t been as aggressive and it fractured its attention to launch the video streaming service Vdio . Rdio needs to lock in more casual listeners before iTunes Radio comes out or Spotify gets any bigger, otherwise it could be stuck with its stylish but small user base. You can’t make a business just selling to hipsters unless you’re Pabst Blue Ribbon.

"Google Quietly Rolls Out An Ipad Version Of Inbox

Inbox by Gmail (Google’s still-invite-only email client) seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it sort of thing, but in case you happen to fall in the “love it” camp and use an iPad: good news! Inbox is getting a proper iPad app. It seems Google is trying to keep it under wraps for the time being (they generally like to announce these things themselves), but the company has quietly started rolling out an iPad-native build of Inbox in select countries. (Update: And now the US! See below.) It’s not available in the U.S. just yet, though the U.S. App store will cough up screenshots if you poke it in the right places. Alas, unless you’re in Germany or you’ve got a German iTunes account handy, you’re stuck waiting for Google to push the update live wherever you may be. Given that the screenshots are already popping up in the U.S. store, I’d bet on the update itself hitting the U.S. App Store within the next few hours. ( Update: See below ) Update: Hey, what do you know! Shortly after we posted this, it went live in the US App Store . It’s not showing up as an update just yet if you’ve already got it installed, but a fresh install of the app pulled down the iPad-native build.

"Amazon Pumps Up Kindle Fire Gaming With Gamecircle, Opens Apis To Developers

Amazon has just announced a bit of good news for avid Kindle Fire gamers and developers — the company has been working to revamp the gaming experience on their wallet-conscious tablet and have decided to share the fruits of their labor . Starting today, developers can use Amazon’s GameCircle APIs to implement a host of new features in their Kindle Fire games. Considering how many other console and mobile gaming platforms already support them, it should come as no surprise that support for achievements is on that list of features. Also on deck is leaderboard functionality, which allows users to see how they stack up to their rivals without having to pop out of the game in question. So far, it all sounds very Game Center-y (though Amazon could do worse than to take cues from Apple), but GameCircle has one last trick up its sleeve. Perhaps the most immediately impressive feature is GameCircle’s sync functionality, which automatically saves a player’s progress to the cloud. As such, players are able to pick up where they left off even if they’ve had to re-install the game in question or switch devices. It’s an interesting play to see from Amazon, and arguably it’s one they need to make. The Seattle-based retail giant is about to face some very stiff competition in the low-cost tablet space thanks to Google’s Nexus 7, but Amazon’s content and media ecosystem is still perhaps their strongest differentiator. With GameCircle, Amazon is trying to improve a very specific segment of that ecosystem, though it’s unclear at this point how many game developers will flock to their APIs. Of course, it’s very possible that GameCircle’s impact isn’t intended to end with the company’s tablets. Rumors that Amazon is working on a new smartphone are making the rounds with renewed intensity — even the Wall Street Journal got in on the fun recently, claiming that the Amazon phone will sport a four- or five-inch screen. Though details are still sparse at this point, don’t be surprised if whatever Amazon is working on ends up playing nice with GameCircle too.

"Top 10 Reasons The Apple Ipad Will Put Amazon'S Kindle Out Of Business

Editor’s note : Ever since yesterday’s debut of Apple’s iPad, the debate has been raging about what it means for Amazon’s Kindle .  Will it kill it?  Will it not?  Is comparing the two like comparing a computer to a typewriter ?  To add fuel to the fire and, well, because we love top 10 lists, we present this guest post from Ben Elowitz , who comes down very firmly on the Kindle-is-kaput side of the debate.  Ben is co-founder and CEO of Wetpaint , a media company with an audience of 10 million monthly unique users; and author of the Digital Quarters blog. Prior to Wetpaint, he co-founded Blue Nile (NILE), the largest online retailer of fine jewelry. 1) The multi-functional capability. Buy a Kindle and you get… a reader.  Another dedicated device to carry.  Buy an iPad, and you get a whole new companion that can do pretty much anything.  Games, movies, browsing, documents, and more—all in one.  And zillions of iPhone apps.  It’s sooooo much more than a reader, it’s a whole-life device. 2) The screen. Full color, multi-touch screen, gestures, and more.  It’s a pleasure to look at it – and we all can rely on Steve Jobs’ aesthetics to know that it’s a pleasure to hold as well . 3) The compatibility. iPad supports ePub out of the box, overcoming publishers’ resistance to having to support a proprietary format such as Kindle’s; and creating compatibility with books sold through a leading standard format through any channel.  (Something tells me Amazon will be making an announcement about ePub support real soon…) 4) The iBooks store. Apple has captured the magic of shopping.  Once again, whereas Amazon does great with the functional needs of buying a book, Apple goes beyond to create an experience. 5) The experience. The Kindle provides a good functional experience for readers—in a very Bezosian way, it meets all our needs.  But Apple’s creation goes beyond, to make the experience fun and cool.  You can swipe through pages on an iPad.  On the Kindle, you have to dutifully click a button. 6) The economics. Publishers have been deeply concerned about price erosion with Amazon’s $9.99 pricing—and have been up in arms over Amazon’s 70% revenue share take.  Though Amazon has reversed the revenue share (to match Apple’s reported offer at 30%), it would require publishers to cut prices and offer deep discounts.  Considering the threat the publishing industry is under, the last thing that publishers want in a time of transition is to have their revenues crammed down further by Jeff Bezos. 7) The apps. In a digital age, a book is (finally!) becoming more than just words on a page.  But the Kindle has been slow to recognize this.  With the iPad, out of the gate publishers can create whole experiences .  Want to create something unique in the market to draw consumers? Publishers can go beyond e-books, and create an app using one of the world’s most popular SDK platforms. 8) The marketplace. Apple’s iBook and App Store marketplaces will instantly be a must-attend venue for publishers.  The anticipated sales of the iPad will mean exposure to so many more consumers than Kindle; and Apple already has 125 million consumer store accounts with 12 billion products already downloaded.  Amazon won’t even release the number of Kindles sold, because the number of consumers buying its device pales next to Apple’s reach. 9) The price. For $10 more than a Kindle DX, consumers get an incredible ebook reader, and so much more:  a device that they can use for, well, pretty much anything.  The options, consumer experience, and flexibility for that $10 are a no-brainer. 10) The Apple factor (a.k.a. “sexy”). Let’s face it, Apple is a brand people want to be affiliated with.  It has a cool factor.  Even those of us who are smart enough to know better still fall in love with Apple products, and carry them with pride.  Amazon just doesn’t have that. As Jason Kottke says , “the iPad makes the Kindle look like it’s from the 1980’s”. Apple has upped the game for Amazon.  Jeff Bezos and his team better start a clean sheet of design if they want Kindle to catch up again and play as a leader with consumers. It’s clear that Amazon is already scared:  witness their recent moves in the last few days running up to Apple’s announcement.  Just this month, they’ve announced an app framework and a new royalty structure to be more attractive to publishers – and both moves are clearly defensive catch-up plays to respond to the threat of the iPad.  Amazon is even trying to win love by giving away free Kindles to their best customers. But the best plan for Amazon isn’t to try to buy customers or try to match Apple’s approach.  Rather, they’ll need to re-think their consumer experience from  start to finish.  They’ve done a great job so far of digitizing books, but now if they want to compete with Steve Jobs’ inventiveness, they’ll have to step up to be a must-have device in consumers’ digital lives.  Of course, they can also just surrender and continue to sell books through their existing iPhone app, which should be compatible with the iPad like all the other apps in the App Store.

"10 Years In, Adblock Plus Passes 500 Million Downloads

 Adblock Plus , the world’s most popular ad-blocking tool, today announced it has passed 500 million downloads. The half-a-billion milestone was achieved after 10 years: It just so happens that this is the same week that Wladimir Palant wrote Adblock Plus 0.6 for Mozilla Firefox back in 2006.  It’s important to emphasize that the company is highlighting downloads, not active users. Adblock Plus didn’t share an update on the number of active users it has.  According to the most-recently shared numbers, Adblock Plus has over 50 million active users while AdBlock , another popular ad-blocking solution, has over 40 million active users. Both tools are available across multiple platforms, so keep in mind that these numbers span various types of devices.  Adblock Plus took the opportunity today to give an account of the last decade. The most interesting part is the very beginning:  The first ad blocker was written by a guy named Henrik Aasted Sørensen. It didn’t really gain much popularity outside tech circles, though, and eventually the code was ignored and passed around to a few different developers. No one really stuck with it till 2006, when Wladimir Palant rewrote it.  “I thought that I would quickly improve Adblock, make it good enough to become the #1 extension — and be done with it,” Palant explained. “Didn’t quite work out the way I hoped, turned out that with projects like that there is always something to do. Ten years went by and I’m still busy with it.”  Eyeo, the Germany-based company behind the Adblock Plus software, now employs 49 people from 17 different countries . In addition to maintaining the actual ad-blocking tool, the team helps manage its Acceptable Ads initiative, which selectively blocks advertising. Nonintrusive ads (the whitelist now has over 700 entities) are allowed through in an attempt to find a compromise between users and advertisers.  That list has had an interesting impact on the advertising industry, though the company doesn’t share what percentage of users keep it on. Still, with 50 million users across the desktop (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE) and mobile (Android and iOS), Adblock Plus has a massive reach that the advertising industry can’t ignore. We’d bet it will take the tool less than 10 years to pass 1 billion downloads.

"Apples And Oranges: Twitter Says It Has 190 Million Unique Visitors

 Twitter chief operating officer Dick Costolo  revealed that the company is seeing 190 million unique visitors a month and 65 million tweets a day in New York today.  The choice of metrics is interesting, in part, because Twitter is using one of the highest possible numbers afforded to it. The microblogging service, which lets users post tweets, or short, 140-character updates visible to everyone on the Internet or just friends, is counting all visitors, not active users or even registered users. By the same metrics, Facebook could claim to have 1.2 billion unique visitors a month . (Facebook publicly says it has more than 400 million active users, but that figure may be closer to 500 million now, since it’s four months old and Facebook continues to grow quickly.)  Of course, from another perspective, Twitter’s figures could also underestimate usage somewhat. There are plenty of users who access Twitter completely independently of the website. The microblogging network said 75 percent of its traffic came via its application programming interfaces during its April developer conference in San Francisco. At the same event, the company said it had 105 million registered users . It added that it was seeing 300,000 new users a day. If its growth stayed consistent,  then the service would have about 122 million registered users by now.

"With New Profile Pages, Think Gaming Wants To Become Angellist For Game Developers

New York City-based gaming analytics company Think Gaming already provides data that should help mobile developers find out how users are interacting with their games and how those games stack up against the competition. Now, with the help of new game profile pages, the company wants to help game developers find potential investors, acquirers, and distribution partners. Think Gaming was founded on the idea of providing developers with a scouting report that evaluates a game’s chances of becoming a hit, based on a number of different metrics. Taking into account gameplay and the type of game that has been released, the report measures retention, monetization, market size, and longevity. Those metrics can then be compared to other comparable games to give developers ideas around how they can improve and compete against some of their top-grossing peers. But all of that was sort of behind the scenes. Now Think Gaming is giving developers tools to share their metrics with folks that could help them, like those with money or distribution. Most independent developers don’t have the marketing power or the user acquisition experience to take their games to the next level. With Think Gaming’s profiles, they can show off metrics that show how valuable their games are to folks who can optimize gameplay and monetization, or help with localization to reach a broader set of users. On the other side, investors and publishers can scour profiles to find games that they’d like to work with. They can search profiles by game type or score, as well as a number of other metrics, to find games they think could be breakout hits. Think Gaming was founded by Tim Ogilvie, who sold demand-side ad platform AdBuyer.com to MediaBank in 2011, along with [x+1] founder Ted Shergalis and Squrl founder Michael Hoydich.

"San Francisco Coffee Chain, Blue Bottle, Raises $20M

  $20 million is quite a hill of beans, and it’s an especially large hill for a coffee chain with 11 locations. But that’s just what Blue Bottle Coffee is sitting on top of right now.  Blue Bottle is a high-quality purveyor of coffee that roasts its beans in small batches using vintage roasting machines, packs them in compostable bags, and sells them within 48 hours of roasting. Like other quality, “slow coffee” shops that have sprung up in the past few years, such as Ritual Roasters and Philz, Blue Bottle’s usual method of preparation is the pour-over : What your dad probably called “drip” coffee, except this is done with great care, one cup at a time, by a specially-trained barista.  The coffee is delicious, and while pricey, it doesn’t seem too expensive for those already softened up by several decades of buying brews at national chains: $2.50 per cup or so.  Perhaps thanks to that high sticker price, Blue Bottle is a surprisingly big business for a coffee chain with seven San Francisco Locations and four in New York. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that the company pulled in $15 to $20 million in revenue last year. Even more attractive to the venture capitalists who are investing in the coffee business is the fact that its revenues have grown by 50 percent every year since the company was founded.  Still, it’s hard to imagine what a coffee chain with seven San Francisco locations, four in New York, and a dedication to craft-roasting beans needs with $20 million. Expansion? A Blue Bottle in every mall? Its own 3-D iPad app?  The fund raise is disclosed in an SEC filing that appeared today. True Ventures led the round, according to Tony Conrad, a venture partner at the VC firm.  Blue Bottle is based in Oakland, Calif. and employs about 200 people in San Francisco and New York.  Corrected 10/17: True Ventures led the funding round, not Index Ventures.

"Facebook Home Is Following Microsoft In Putting You And Your Friends First

  Facebook describes its new Android app suite, Facebook Home, as “a new way to organize the information on your phone.”  That’s what Facebook product director Adam Mosseri told VentureBeat earlier this week . He’s right, to a point: The interface is novel.  But the idea of putting the information you care about most (pictures from your friends, Facebook updates, chat bubbles) right on your phone’s home screen and lock screen? Well, that isn’t new. Its most immediate antecedent is Windows Phone 8, which added a customizable lock screen , including the ability to show photos from your Facebook feed, in October, 2012.  Above: Microsoft’s Kin One and Kin Two were a commercial disaster, but showed the way for Windows Phone and Facebook Home. Image Credit: Microsoft  In fact, Windows Phone has been organized around this principle since version 7, its modern overhaul. And before that, it was preceded by social-centric experiments Microsoft conducted with its ill-fated Kin phones, which were a commercial and critical disaster, but prefigured the company’s interest in putting social media front and center.  Android and iOS are centered on small app icons, with optional small “badges” that show a tidbit of information about the app, such as the number of unread email message. By contrast, Windows Phone 7 and 8 are organized around app tiles, which give more room to the app’s content. Instead of an icon showing a skeuomorphic picture of a desk calendar, Windows Phone’s calendar appear appears as a big rectangle, with most of the real estate given to showing the details of your next upcoming appointment.  That user-centric orientation made Windows Phone remarkably fun to use, in my experience. (At least until I got fed up with Nokia’s dysfunctional hardware and AT&T’s miserable policies .) Pulling out my phone and turning it on was no longer an exercise in getting some specific task done. It was a mini-surprise every time: Each time I took the phone out there was some new tidbit of information from my life or photo from the people I cared about.  I don’t want to overstate the significance of this change. It’s really only a tap or two from the home screen icon to the full Facebook feed in your Facebook app, no matter what phone OS you’re using. So it’s not going to make an enormous difference to the experience of using Facebook: It’s likely to be more or less the same on Android, iOS, Windows Phone, or Facebook Home phones.  But I suspect it will make the experience of using the phone subtly different, making it more and more into your primary hub for experiencing your social network. On Windows Phone, that could mean Skype, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. In the case of Facebook Home, that means Facebook, full stop.  If this is the future of phone OS design, and I think it is, then Facebook has just made an early and smart move. It has staked out a user-centric POV and associated it closely with its own network and brand.  Either that or it has just made its own version of the Microsoft Kin.

"Cdns Are Big Business, Edgecast Get $6 Million

When we watch movies or play music online, there’s a flurry of unseen activity making sure that data arrives when and where it’s supposed to be. This is the job of the high speed fiber and computer systems of the internet’s content distribution networks (CDNs). Every website that streams content (live video, music) needs a CDN. The flurry of new media online has made it a prime time for companies like Akamai, Limelight Networks, Level 3, VitalStream, BitGravity, and EdgeCast who provide fast and efficient ways to deliver rich media to millions on the internet. The market is estimated to be around $800 million, of which Akamai controls about half. One of the newer networks, EdgeCast (2006), has closed a $6 million in Series B financing led by Steamboat Ventures, which is affiliated with The Walt Disney Company, bringing their total financing to $10 million. Steamboat joins Series A investors such as Mark Amin, Chairman of CinemaNow as well as Jon Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate films. The new funds will be used to expand internationally, scale the network for additional capacity, enhance features, and market to more businesses. EdgeCast has distinguished itself from other CDNs by charging for bandwidth instead of lumping the cost in with the cost of other CDN services. This means customers should see declines in their bill as bandwidth costs drop. But these businesses are as much defined by their customer list as pricing plans. Level3 provides the backbone for YouTube’s content. Limelight handles Microsoft and Amazon Unbox. BitGravity serves Revision3. EdgeCast’s most recognizable customer is IMAX, but their investment from Steamboat Ventures leads me to believe they’ll be the CDN of choice for Disney as well.

"Using Antonyms To Understand The Difference Between The Cloud And Everything Else

The difference between new and not-so-new technology has a way of revealing what is elastic and dynamic compared to what is rigid and static. It’s not a measure of which technology is considered good or bad. It simply represents the progression from client/server technology to the Internet-scale, data-driven services that are gaining such momentum. Using antonyms helps better correlate what is considered a cloud service and what is not, as well as the relative relationship between an online service like Google Docs as compared to a Microsoft Word document. The differences can help understand the new way IT services are delivered as compared to older methods. Randy Bias, founder of Cloudscaling , did a keynote at Interop’s Enterprise Summit two years ago and argued that elasticity is a side effect of cloud computing . The infrastructure of cloud/web scale operations is fundamentally different from mainframes and client/server technologies. The big Internet companies have had to create an infrastructure that could scale and be highly efficient and fast. The result: new ways to think of how we manage data. Mark Thiele is executive vice president at Switch , which runs “SuperNap,” one of the most sophisticated data centers in the world. He said this to me today on Twitter: Elasticity is a side effect of Internet-scale businesses. But with the introduction of the smartphone, the notion of elasticity becomes more abstract. A smartphone is a node. It is a dynamic object existing on an elastic infrastructure. But it is also inelastic, often running enterprise software managed by IT. As another example, Google Docs runs on an elastic infrastructure. Microsoft Word running off the client server is not. Mark Thiele questioned this view of elasticity when he asked me this question in a private exchange on Twitter: I responded that the antonyms may not always be relative. They may still have an opposite meaning but exist in what Wikipedia refers to as a common continuous spectrum . A downloaded copy of Microsoft Word is managed through the elasticity of the more modern infrastructure. Pradeep Prabhu is the co-founder at CloudMunch , an end-to-end platform for managing development and application lifecycle management development. Pradhu views the traditional developer software stack as not elastic. Cloud services connecting with other cloud services is elastic, Prabhu said. “When code gets developed by a developer — they get an elastic infrastructure and tooling that will take that code and build it, test it and deploy into the cloud,” he said. “It is completely elastic.” Elasticity has a meaning relevant to the way IT services are delivered. Understanding its oppposite meaning can help clarify the difference and similarities between Internet-scale architecture and its client/server counterpart.

"Roku Makes A Run For The Border, Launching In The Uk And Canada Soon

 Roku , the company known for its line of affordable set-top boxes , is planning to expand into U.K. and Canada, the company announced today.  The company’s set-top boxes, which range in price from $49-$99, allow people to access over 350 channels of content from video, music, social and gaming services. The move makes sense for Roku since its largest media partner, Netflix, is already available in Canada and will soon launch in the U.K.  Netflix has been an integral part of Roku’s success since launching in 2008. The partnership helped Roku sell over a million set-top boxes last year. The latest version of Roku’s boxes even feature a Netflix button on the remote. It’s no wonder that the company has waited until now to enter into international markets.  However, many of the other media partners are region specific due to legal issues around streaming video content internationally. This means they won’t necessarily be available in other countries. For instance, Hulu Plus, which offers a variety of ad-supported premium TV content, won’t be crossing the border when Roku debuts in the new markets. It’ll be interesting to see who Roku is able to forge partnerships with when it launches internationally.  Roku is scheduled to begin selling its line of set-boxes in both countries in early 2012, according to the company.

"Make Video Calls From Your Cellphone (If You Live In Canada)

Marvel at the wonders of 3G! Up in Canada, cellphone provider Rogers will be the first carrier in North America to let its users make video calls. This high bandwidth activity is made possible by the company’s shiny new HSDPA network. Rogers also plans to use all this extra bandwidth (current HSDPA speeds range from 1.8Mbits/s to 14.4Mbits/s) to funnel to its subscribers the weekly top 50 YouTube videos. Now you can watch Carl Rove control the mic while on-the-go! Meanwhile, those of us in the U.S. are still waiting for some sort of decent 3G network. Meh, cellphones are a fad anyway.

"Rim Announces The Bbx Platform, The Future Of Blackberry

Mike Lazaridis, CEO of Research in Motion, “The whole company is aligning behind this single vision. It combines the best of QNX and Blackberry.” Meet BBX. BBX is the future of RIM. Dan Dodge, president of QNX, joined Mike Lazaridis and proudly co-announced BBX. This platform incorporates enterprise, NOC and cloud services into one system that can run on smartphones, tablets and embedded systems. As Lazaridis stated, BBX is about bringing together “people, devices, content, and services.” RIM and QNX built BBX to be secure. The platform is IEEE POSIX certified and conforms to EAL4+ and IEC 61508 Safety (SIL3) standards. The POSIX cert should allow for easy porting of Linux/Unix apps while providing a good deal of security. HTML 5 is a big part of BBX. RIM sees the protocol as a bridge to older BB OS systems. Since BB 5 and BB 6 runs HTML 5, developers can code in HTML 5 for future and older devices. Details are still a bit light despite the company spending a good deal of time during the DEVCOM keynote. More info will come from the Tech Keynote address at a later time.

"Wii Are Amused By This Article

Bits Bytes Pixels & Sprites has a pretty decent article on the Nintendo Wii and what needs to be improved upon it. Excellent reasoning is given to each problem the Wii is plagued by. For instance, why does the Wii use Nintendo’s horrible system of friend codes? If I want to add my friend to a buddy list, I should just be able to throw in their user name and be done with it. Other rants include the complete lack of online games, the problem with games being designed in 4:3 ratio, no downloadable content for games (such as new Smash Bros. characters), and no rechargeable batteries. After all, that Wiimote does seem to blow through batteries pretty quickly. Be sure to check the article out so you can see 10 real issues the Wii needs to get fixed. Wii Want Improvements [TBBPS]

"Shazam, Delivery Agent Partner To Let You Buy Your Favorite Tv Characters’ Stuff

Well, I’m not sure whether to be worried about our impending laziness or thrilled that I can now shop while I watch TV ( without the help of the Home Shopping Network). Shazam , potentially one of the most magical apps ever, has partnered with Delivery Agent to let you discover consumer products in TV shows and ultimately purchase them. First to jump on board with the service is NBCUniversal, more specifically the program Covert Affairs , with other programming to follow. Just like you Shazam music you love, the service will let you tag Covert Affairs episodes, which will then serve up different products that are relevant. So let’s say that Covert Affairs main character Annie is getting dressed on the show, and you notice that her outfit is exactly what you’ve been looking for. Simply tag the episode and voila! Delivery Agent pulls any items available for purchase right into the Shazam app. Along with apparel and accessories within the programming, this new service will also let users buy program-branded goodies, like a Covert Affairs mug or t-shirt. In all honesty, the shopping selection probably won’t be that great at first, and obviously not everyone is a Covert Affairs die-hard. But if this thing blows up the same way Shazam did, you’ll want to be able to tell your friends you were doing it before it was cool.

"Yahoo Rolls Out New Encryption For Email — But Not Until The Fall

 LAS VEGAS — With Marissa Mayer at the helm, Yahoo Mail is looking more like Gmail every day.  First the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company announced in April that it would roll out enhanced encryption for its Yahoo email offerings in reaction, mostly, to the knowledge imparted by former National Security Agency systems administrator Edward Snowden that his former employer was routinely boosting data with little difficulty from Yahoo’s servers.  And today at the Black Hat security conference here in Las Vegas (where mid-day temperatures were hovering at a respectable 98 degrees in the shade), Yahoo’s new security researcher and veep of information security, Alex Stamos, officially disclosed that his company intends to roll out end-to-end encryption in its email service in the fall.  It means that, at least in the short term, that Yahoo emailers can reportedly send safe and secure messages between Yahoo users and also Gmail adherents with little fear, theoretically at least, that the messages cannot be successfully intercepted by guys sitting in windowless rooms back at Fort Meade in Maryland.  In a talk today, Stamos put it this way:   “If an activist in Sudan wants to email a human rights organization’s Gmail address and they have encryption set up for it, it will automatically detect that and offer them the option to encrypt.”   Stamos stressed that Yahoo email encryption will be easy to use, with little or no friction. To that end, Yahoo will soup up its encryption plug, something that Gmail has already done. Yahoo is also enlisting a former Electronic Frontier Foundation techie, Yan Zhu, to assist in the overhaul. Zhu is apparently no friend of the NSA.  Yahoo, in fact, is adapting an encryption standard that has been around for a while, called PGP, or Pretty Good Encryption, that noted cryptographer Phil Zimmerman developed.  For Yahoo users, this means that while the subject line of your email won’t be encrypted, your dispatch will. PGP makes it harder for lurkers to intercept and decrypt the message while en route from sender to recipient.  And there you have it.

"Zokem Raises $2.4M For Holistic Mobile Analytics

 Zokem , a provider of mobile analytics based on on-device sensoring, has raised $2.4 million (2 million euros) .  Based in Finland, the company plans to use the money for aggressive  global expansion and has brought in four new staff members to help  execute it.  Initially, Zokem’s plan was to work with carriers  and mobile handset makers, but now it has shifted its focus to media  measurement companies and relevant research agencies. It says it can  provide these organizations with a window into how and how much people  are using their phones — extremely marketable information. Some of its products are targeted at regular consumers too.  Many  other mobile analytics services depend on applications and networks to  gather analytics data about phone usage. Instead, Zokem collects this  granular data directly from users’ smartphones. For example, it could  show customers which Android games are the most popular, or which search  engines have proved to be the most useful.  Zokem keeps tabs on  voice services, as well as entertainment applications, music use, device  feature use, and phone browser market share. It is compatible with  Android, the iPhone OS, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Symbian. In fact,  the company has close ties to Nokia — its CEO Ludovic Gaude led global  sales at Nokia, as well as strategic partnerships at Google.  One  of Zokem’s earlier consumer-facing applications, Zoki Social Assistant, has  made it into all of the major application stores, the company says. That app leverages collected data to give users suggestions for  improving the way they use social media to manage their lives .  Founded in 2008, the company’s recent round of funding came from several European venture capitalists and angel investors.

"Youtube Leanback, Hulu Plus, And Even Google Tv Will Not Break Us Away From Traditional Pay Tv Services

Listen, I hate forking over $100 a month for my TV, too. I also wholeheartedly agree with The Consumerist picking Comcast as the worst company in America . But they still get my money every month and just like the vast majority of people who pay for their TV, that’s not going to change anytime soon. There simply isn’t anything that replicates the experience and is free or low-cost. No one, not even Google, Hulu or Netflix , will cause America to part ways with the subscription-based TV model. The newest contender in the field is YouTube Leanback, which cleans up the interface and makes for a much more relaxed viewing experience. As the name implies, the interface is perfect for casual YouTube use, either from your couch or office chair. As Jason pointed out when the product launched yesterday, its aim is to increase the average YouTube viewing time. Currently it’s 15 minutes per day compared to the 5 hours netted by traditional TV. It will probably do just that, seeing as Leanback is YouTube’s Google TV offering. The dozens of first adopters that jump on that ship right away will no doubt spend hours using the interface — until the novelty wears off. YouTube obviously has a different draw than traditional TV programs. Most of the videos are short clips, designed for the short attention span of the average Internet user. Leanback is designed to counter this by auto-playing another video after one finishes playing. Great, but do you think that YouTube content alone can sufficiently replace cable? Of course not. But even Hulu Plus or Netflix Streaming has the goods to do that and likely never will. Hulu and Netflix have impressive libraries. I’m not going to debate that, but there are two huge things missing: the joy of channel surfing and most importantly, live TV. These two items, combined with the technical aspects of cable TV alternatives will keep the masses from making the switch away from cable and satellite companies for years. Leanback has got one thing right: watching TV is a passive activity. Channel surfing is something that’s supposed to be done while your mind is on autopilot. That’s why videos are automatically selected and played. That’s not the case in Hulu or Netflix primarily because the content is different. Sure, Hulu Desktop autoplays something when its launched, but it’s mostly always an advertisement of some sort, not actually TV content. Users have to go out and actively decide what program to watch. Netflix streaming is even worse for lazy people. On most streaming-capable devices, users actually have to pre-select content they want streamed on their PC. Do you really think your mother-in-law is going to do that? Step one, fire up IE6 and wait 5 minutes for all the toolbars to load . Step two, call you because she forgot the web address. Step three, navigate to the Netflix website and log in (if she remembers her password) Step four, discover that the program she wants to watch isn’t available for streaming. Cable and satellite companies aren’t going anywhere. It’s not even just the baby boomers and greatest generation keeping them around, as is the case with print media. Both Gen X and Gen Yers are cable subscribers too. Opting for these cable alternatives isn’t generational like reading the newspaper, it’s more about the demographics. Actually, some people already canceled their cable and use sites like Hulu and Netflix exclusively (they are probably flaming me in the comments right now). They might have a Mac Mini or even full desktop sitting in their living rooms connected to their HDTV. But most of these people are in this certain demographic that spans multiple generations and are comfortable with technology. Those that try to follow the same path but aren’t computer savvy (like my in-laws) more often than not end up back paying for traditional TV. You, me, and our geeky friends would probably be happy with the grand trifecta of streaming content from a Hulu-like site, live HDTV from over-the-air, and YouTube for shits and giggles. But my wife would kill me if I canceled our cable and replaced it with something like that — unless it worked flawlessly. That’s the key, really. The device would have to work as well as TiVo, all of the time, for every program. It cannot be the Android of TV appliances. Users must be able to sit down and operate it with little or no effort. They must be able to hit a channel button and skip to another program immediately. Just like in radio, dead air would kill the device. I know I’m painting a poor image of the average TV watcher. But it’s the truth. TV is now the great American pastime and people are passionate about it. I know I am. I once told someone that watching TV was my hobby and at the time it was. I later discovered woodworking, but that’s another post. Pay TV isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it might become more popular before it declines as, ironically, cable companies improving their streaming libraries. Not even Google TV will make a dent in Comcast’s juicy bottom line. People are lazy, don’t like change, and simply do not want to give up silly luxuries. If the recession didn’t kill cable, nothing will anytime soon.

"Yet Another Bitcoin Exchange Implodes: Vircurex Will Freeze Accounts Tomorrow

 Vircurex is the latest company to join the growing list of insolvent Bitcoin exchanges, according to a statement issued on its site today.  Vircurex announced that it will immediately stop withdrawals of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other virtual currencies, reports The Next Web . Starting tomorrow, Vircurex plans to freeze all user accounts.  Plagued by two hacking incidents last year, Vircurex previously pledged to cover its users’ losses via its own income. Due to “large fund withdrawals in the last weeks,” Vircurex claims it has taken the above actions to prevent the service from shutting down entirely.  “Unfortunately we had large fund withdrawals in the last weeks which have led to a complete depletion of our cold wallet balance and we are now facing the option of either closing the site with significant unrecoverable losses for all or to work out a solution that allows the exchange to continue to operate and gradually pay back the losses.”  This news follows the catastrophic shutdown of Mt. Gox , once the largest Bitcoin exchange in existence, on Feburary 25. Other prominent exchanges have ended in sudden shutdowns, including Flexcoin on March 5 , and Crypto-Trade on February 27 .

"Github Passes The 3 Million Developer Mark

GitHub has passed the 3 million-developer mark , a milestone for the collaborative platform for application development. GitHub said it happened Monday night on the first day of the company’s all-hands winter summit. Launched in April 2008, GitHub celebrated its first million users in September 2011. The company hit the 2 million mark in August 2012, just short of a year later. How many users GitHub draws in the next 12 months is anybody’s guess, but it’s fair to say that it will at least double or perhaps even triple. According to the blog, GitHub will soon see the 5 millionth repository being hosted on GitHub any week now . And to celebrate, GitHub is having a party this Thursday at Code Bass in San Francisco. Now is a good time to celebrate for GitHub, as it has had a phenomenal year. They have shown how important it is for developers to collaborate, which represents the future for how apps will get developed. Over the summer, GitHub raised $100 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz to pursue an enterprise strategy. The company will use the investment to build out an on-premise version of its technology. GitHub’s news is also a reflection on the state of app development in both software and hardware. It’s evident this week at the Open Compute Summit where the focus is on the re-examination of the data center and the need to open up design. Collaboration is emerging as the bonding force for the organization. Manufacturers like Intel are opening their hardware specs so anyone can build out an infrastructure based upon open designs. GitHub’s 3 million users shows how collaboration is, perhaps, the most important movement in tech. With the pace of development, it can be expected that GitHub has hit a deep vein and should continue to see developers flock to the service.
